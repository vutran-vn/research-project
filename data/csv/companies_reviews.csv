FreshBooks,Write a review,Michael Horth,"Monday, March 25, 2013","Accounting isn't my thing, but FreshBooks makes it easy for me to keep on top of things. Their iPad app is really great for when I'm on the job and want to get paid quick."
FreshBooks,Write a review,Melanie,"Friday, March 22, 2013",Invoicing with FreshBooks saves me so much time. It means I never have to make a call to clients who haven't paid - their automated email system reminds my clients for me!
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kyle Szigeti,"Monday, June 23, 2014","We have been using Intacct for 1.5 years here at Birch Communications. The integration process was not very complicated. We enjoy all of the features that Intacct provides including the custom report writer, drill down capabilities, multi entity reporting, etc. We used Sage Accpac previously and Intacct has been a significant upgrade for our accounting/reporting."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jenni Reiserer,"Tuesday, June 17, 2014","We were using Peachtree previously and had outgrown that product. Intacct gave us the ability to stop relying on spreadsheets to make our revenue recognition entries. This in turn gave us an annual ROI of around $50k because I was on the verge of having to hire someone to keep up with our growing revenue recognition issues. Since 2009 I have not had to add another employee to my department and I attribute that to the use of Intacct and the improvements they have made to their own product. Total estimated savings is over $250,000.There are so many reasons why I like Intacct. The ease of use for our employees is probably one of my favorites. We are a growing software company and every new employee gets a sign in to Intacct so that they can enter their time sheets and expenses. Most employees need minimal training and some have logged in and gotten started without training.Another of my favorites is the dashboards and how easy it is to put a report on one and to make them look professional. We have dashboards for all department heads and even one that is for the typical employee. Now with the latest enhancements getting the most up to date and important info is even easier. The dashboards make me look good to my boss which is a great plus."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Chelsea Parent,"Friday, June 13, 2014","Intacct has been a great company to work with. We are a very tough type of company with very hard financials. Our CEO and CFO have always asked for things that required a lot of manual manipulation, but now that we have Intacct, we are able to create the reports they want and send them out with ease. We are so happy that we've made the switch to Intacct."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kelley,"Thursday, June 12, 2014",INTACCT is great. It's very user friendly and easy to learn. It's pleasant to look at and you can adapt it to your liking by changing colors or menu options.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jennifer Szaro Oehlerts,"Wednesday, June 11, 2014","Intacct had great rev rec schedules.  A significant portion of our revenue is from annual support payments that we recognize over the time period of the annual support.  The Revenue/Accounts Receivable Module makes it easy to record and recognize this revenue automatically rather than having to track it on a spreadsheet and figure out what needs to be recorded monthly.  This is a strong attribute of the software.  Secondarily, being a cloud based solutions has been very helpful when not in the office.Some frustration with the software revolves around the inability to change certain.  For example, once a cash payment has been received, the entry that recorded the invoice cannot be changed.  If you want/need to add a location or department, it can't be done.  Also, the inability to merge accounts and departments to make a more streamlined chart of accounts (especially when you inherited a mess) is frustrating.  There should be more flexibility to make changes.  I know other systems have this flexibility."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Emma Roy,"Tuesday, June 10, 2014","A great cloud based accounting system that has integrated perfectly with our other cloud based programs like Concur expense. The transition to Intacct went very smooth, the program is easy to use, and the reporting is comprehensive. Switching to Intacct allowed us to simplify our GL, going from over 3,000 accounts to under 200. The budgeting features in the program are also really good. Would highly recommend this product.  "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Sadia Jamil,"Monday, June 9, 2014",A best cloud based accounting software for complicated and time consuming revenue recognition process. Data import option is very helpful and time saving.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Cecillia Rivas,"Friday, March 21, 2014",Intacct is a cloud based accounting software that has been easy to learn on the fly. It's great to be able to work away from the office anytime I need to access the software. It is a good choice for any size organization and any industry.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Autumn Kelly,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","A solid accounting program with the capability to run custom reports and analyze projects by time/cost/employee. These capabilities are useful for helping our company keep projects within budget and time scope. I should note, however, that any of our employees have difficulties accessing/using the website with Firefox and Chrome browsers."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jennifer Bomba,"Thursday, March 20, 2014",Intacct is an easy and very effective accounting software to use. I use it everyday with my job and what used to take me hours to do now takes me mere minutes. Thanks Intacct!
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Erika Williams,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","Wonderful accounting program for a small to mid-sized business, especially non-profits. The customization of order entry and integration with Salesforce was critical for our billing department. This functions seamlessly and saves us so much time. I also love that each release seems to add easier functionality to all of our processes."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Erin Horak,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","I have implemented Intacct at two companies now and for a good reason. Although the companies were in different lines of business and different sizes, Intacct was able to meet the needs of each.  It is customizable yet easy to use, even for a ""non-techy"". I would implement Intacct at any company in the future as well."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,William Koellein,"Tuesday, March 18, 2014","Intacct has provided our organization with a robust versatile accounting system that allowed us to go paperless, provided a mobile application from which budget managers can approve transactions and sign checks, and greatly streamlined our processes and procedures saving us time and money."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Joe K,"Tuesday, March 18, 2014","We use Intacct for contract and revenue management as well as billing and A/R.  It has helped us house 1 single warehouse for our over 900  clients with thousands of transactions monthly. It is much more automated than our previous system and much more transparent.  They bring value with each new update. Even if you don't use some of the new features at times, it's nice to know they are constantly improving their product.  Unfortunately, Intacct has not yet figured out a way to allow users to customize their standard reports by adding fields"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Dane smith,"Monday, March 17, 2014","I don't trust anything but intacct.  Once I started using it, my company was hooked. Things run so smooth and clean. "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jared,"Friday, March 14, 2014",Intacct is a great product that allows you a substantial amount of customization.  My company uses it for a wide range of tasks and provides employees with different dashboards dependent on their job title or practice.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kenny Mitchell,"Friday, March 14, 2014","Intacct is a great solution for any small to mid- market Company. Whether managing a services or technology Company (hardware and/or software)... it has so many intuitive components that you typically don't even see in large enterprise solutions (e.g. Oracle/SAP/etc...) due to the simple integrations to tons of third- party applications. For the $100M enterprise business on Oracle or SAP... Intacct could actually be an alternative to save significant $$$ and get added value out of the finance, accounting, revenue, and reporting teams. This application is not perfect... there are none perfect... no not one. However... I am a finance person by trade, but can configure custom reports, fields, integration field mappings, approvals, workflows, etc... not something I would dare to touch in the clunky world of legacy ""ERPs.""This is not Quickbooks my friends... this is not Dynamics.... or a Netsuite. Intacct appears to be focused on being a cloud- based... well- rounded and intuitive business system built on new technology with lots of features and regular updates that are driven to the new- age of finance operations. If you want to be a bookeeper... don't buy it... because you won't get the value. If you want to be a business partner... go for it!"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Ronald,"Wednesday, March 12, 2014",I have been using this software for a year and it has been great. I'm able to run reports with great options.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Matt Daniels,"Tuesday, March 11, 2014","Intacct is a middle-of-the-road accounting solution. It gets the basics done as any other solution would, but it's not incredibly robust, and some of the navigation is clunky. It can be integrated with Salesforce, which is a plus though. Customized reporting lacks intuitiveness and user-friendliness, but can be learned. Plain and simple, the Intacct solution just works. I can't think of a time I've ever encountered a bug."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Mark H,"Tuesday, March 11, 2014",This is a great system with customer field ability and reporting and great customer support.

My billing and reporting duties can be completed with ease, and I am always learning a new functionality of the system that allows me to perform tasks quicker and more efficiently. Intacct is easy to learn, easy to use, and its possibilities seem endless!"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Teri Opena,"Thursday, March 6, 2014",Intacct is a great tool for our company. We have so many different departments where we are able to use the dashboards to upload our excel files for our whole company to use. It's perfect for our accounting department as it helps keep track of what bills we have paid and what we have not. We are still new to using this product and learning about all of it's capabilities but so far it has helped our company grow in what we can offer to our clients.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kenny C.,"Thursday, March 6, 2014","Intacct is accounting of the future. It streamlines tasks allowing for greater financial clarity. The system itself is user-friendly and designed to provide the best user experience. Reports are designed to be flexible so information is at your disposal in various forms. Overall, a great system with high recommendation. "

Intacct Corporation,Write a review,stephanie denton,"Monday, December 16, 2013","The program is useful for working in the AR department, we are able to view past recent payments, all of our customers accounts and easily switch from tab to tab to review customers accounts. "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Dave Skahan,"Monday, December 16, 2013","I've only been using Intacct for a few months and I found it very easy to pick up and I'm learning more and more complex things in the system each day. Whether I'm using existing reports or creating my own, Intacct is user-friendly and when you can't figure something out, the help function and training/seminars that they offer are quite useful. I also find their offerings to their customers to be frequent and useful and it really is a system that makes a difference in Financial Reporting."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,September Stanley,"Thursday, December 12, 2013",I am a staff accountant with a value added reseller in North Carolina. We recently made the transition from QuickBooks to Intacct and have watched our efficiencies improve drastically! The custom reporting allows you to design and create a plethora of reports so that any information you need is readily available. I would highly recommend Intacct to any company who has outgrown their current ERP software.

The changeover from my other accounting software was  simple enough for me to figure out on my owner, and the import process was accurate and easy. The importing of online statements makes the process so easy and removes the human error of manual data entry. Safe to say, I Love this product!"
Xero,www.xero.com,Cazza,"Wednesday, September 25, 2013","Just got the Xero for dummies book. Love it, it has reassured me what I am doing is correct and after reading only a couple of chapters I can navigate my way round the dashboard etc much quicker. Thank you for another great help tool."

Xero,www.xero.com,Chris,"Tuesday, August 20, 2013","Streamlines the payment process. Tells me when a customer has seen a sent invoice form.  Payment is efficient and makes the online payment process easy both for the business and the consumer. I didn't like not being able to add attachments to the invoices, but other than that it has served my basic needs well. "
Xero,www.xero.com,Ben Foster,"Monday, August 19, 2013"," I was searching for a way to keep all of my books and accounting details up to date and after careful research, I decided Xero was the way to go.  I am glad I chose Xero because I was able to finally do my own taxes and accounting without having to hire a CPA.  As a result, I was able to cut expenses and ended up with a large tax return.  I am now a customer for life."
Xero,www.xero.com,Lee Greenwood,"Friday, August 9, 2013",Easy to use and covers all my bases. Xero lets me track everything I need to keep track of in my business without being needlessly complex. Definitely give this one a free try!

The best thing to do is find software that fits your needs and that is was Xero does. The software makes it quick and extremely easy to manage your account and do various billings.

Xero,www.xero.com,Lucy Enoka,"Tuesday, February 26, 2013","Xero is simply amazing! Everything about it is genius. It is so easy to use. You wont feel like you are doing your accounting. I can honestly say the best thing  about it from switching to Xero a year ago, is the time it has given me back with my 2 small children. I will work anywhere from 6-12 hrs a week on my accounts and the 12 hour week is the billing week. That's all! Our business is classed medium size as well. I can use it anywhere. Go on holiday and still know where im at, pay bills etc. I would be very nervous about changing from them now. There is no better program for us! Change now! Thank you Xero!  "

Xero,www.xero.com,Kassie,"Friday, December 28, 2012","My small business was struggling, we couldn't keep track of our expenses and our invoice system was a joke.

Xero,www.xero.com,Mark Forbes,"Friday, December 14, 2012","I discovered Xero after having a bad experience with another company. Not only is it highly intuitive to use, but the updates to the software happen every few months. If the feature you want is not there now, you can have confidence that it will be there soon. I estimate that I spend 30-50% less time processing transactions, which means more time is available for generating useful management information for my clients. The result is all my clients are now on Xero (and WorkflowMax). Its a no-brainer!"
Xero,www.xero.com,Paul Scott,"Wednesday, December 12, 2012","Xero has proved to be an excellent solution to our accounting needs. Following the SaaS model and being accessible from anywhere makes it really easy for us to share our accounts with our accountants. It also removes the reams of paper we used to have to pass around. It is a fully functional platform providing a great suite of tools for managing your financial business on. We especially like the invoicing integration and the bank feeds. It is almost worth signing up for Xero and then choosing your bank as not all banks are equal. One note is their pricing model, depending on how your business is structured you can find that there is only one small aspect of Xero that is relevant. This would mean you need to move higher up their model. Whether it be the number of invoices or multi-currency support you can find your costs increasing due to a need for one small aspect. However, the functionality and support outweigh this quickly."
Xero,www.xero.com,William S.,"Monday, December 10, 2012",This software has saved me and my business time and money.  It is so simple to understand and use. I can access it on the go from my mobile phone or while I am home. Definitely for the small business owner who is concerned with their bottom line.
Xero,www.xero.com,Marie,"Thursday, November 29, 2012",This software is simple and easy to use. Even beginners can get up to speed on quickly and it really makes your accounting work more productive.

Xero,www.xero.com,Randy,"Wednesday, November 28, 2012",This software has done wonders. I can now manage all the info I need for my business super easy and super fast. I would recommend this for anyone who has to multitask throughout the day.  
Xero,www.xero.com,Robert Ryan,"Monday, November 26, 2012",This product is great. I operate a small video production company that primarily does weddings and event videography. This program is extremely easy to use and even my wife enjoys using it when usually finances stress her out!
Xero,www.xero.com,Anja O'Connor,"Friday, June 8, 2012","Best of breed software at it's best. Another star for creating an environment for integration.

Xero,www.xero.com,Jacqui Jones,"Monday, June 4, 2012","As you can tell with 5 stars all round I am a real fan of Xero. Since early 2008 it has completely changed the relationship I have with 'that side' of my business.As a Mac and PC user who is often out of the office (developing and delivering a business renovation challenge that boosts established Kiwi businesses NZ-wide), and being very committed to providing a good experience for my clients (right through to correct and timely invoicing),  Xero has made a big difference. I am now happy to spend time on 'that side' because the time required is so much shorter - the system is very visual, uncluttered and smart. Xero almost makes 'doing the books' fun and it certainly contributes to peace of mind."
Xero,www.xero.com,Ryan Baker,"Monday, June 4, 2012","We have used Xero since 2007 - for two companies and an investment trust. It is one of the best, if not the best, SaaS app that we have used in our businesses. If you're not using Xero for your accounting software, give it a try. It is addictively awesome."

Connec,www.connec.me,Josh Lee,"Monday, November 18, 2013","My boss asked me to handle her accounting and I wanted something that I could learn easily, handle everything I needed, and be able to access it anywhere.  Definitely great for small businesses!"
Connec,www.connec.me,Yu-De Chen,"Friday, November 15, 2013",My company has used Servora from the very beginning. It's come to the point that we wouldn't know what to do anymore without them. They may lack some features but their customer service and attentiveness is why we love them.
Connec,www.connec.me,Alice Benson,"Monday, November 4, 2013","Servora fulfills all the primary needs for the accounting side of my business. What I love the most about Servora is that they have GREAT customer service! Responsive, professional, and personable! "
Connec,www.connec.me,rod beets,"Monday, October 28, 2013","Great accounting software!!  Makes running day to day business much easier for me.  It can do it all payroll, billing and expenses.  Much cheaper then hiring one of those payroll places.  I will tell anyone opening a company to get this software suite.  It will give you the time to run the business you love and not the paper work you hate."
Connec,www.connec.me,Leo,"Friday, August 2, 2013","I run a small business, and the thing I really like about Servora is that it brings Accounting and CRM features together in ONE system, which helps me focus on growing my company.

I would recommend it to everyone!
Connec,www.connec.me,Charles Chen,"Friday, July 26, 2013",Servora has been awesome to work with. Everything is managed all in one place. There is no integration between software anymore! So happy I went with them instead of getting charged for every integration I had to do with different software.
Connec,www.connec.me,Peter,"Friday, July 26, 2013","Our team has been very happy with the switch to Servora and one thing interesting is the collaboration feature which I haven't seen it in other accounting software. At first we were skeptical and thought it was a gimmick, but it was actually the best invention that could happen to accounting software, I can't believe why anyone hasn't thought of that before! Overall highly recommended and if you have more than one person in your company, this is probably the only choice for you."
Connec,www.connec.me,Melody Huang,"Tuesday, July 23, 2013",Our company has been using Servora for over a year now and I love how we decided to make the switch from Excel and QuickBooks.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Laurie Kaplin,"Thursday, May 15, 2014","My company has been using AvidXchange's AvidInvoice product since 2006.  We use Yardi for our accounting and property management software.  When we started using AvidInvoice we scanned and coded all our own invoices, but we are now using their AvidBill Network -  where Avid scans and (default) codes the invoices before they reach our coders and approvers.Our Avid implementation was extremely easy.  The implementer was here for about a week and we were up and running by the time he left.  The hardest part of the implementation was thinking through the approver roles that we needed and we created this information in a spreadsheet for each property BEFORE our implementer came onsite.  To this day we still use that spreadsheet as our key for the workflows that our invoices follow.  The management process is so much better with Avid and invoices are not lost or left sitting on someone's desk.Our property managers and accountants love that they can look up an invoice for a vendor, see the invoice image, and tell if it's been paid all by themselves.  Management appreciates knowing exactly where our invoices are at any given moment.As my company's software administrator for AvidXchange I can't say there haven't been bumps in the road over the past 8 years, however; AvidXchange is the most responsive and concerned software vendor I've dealt with in my 28 years in the IT industry.  I absolutely recommend AvidXchange software for handling your invoice processing.  They have been a first class company since day one and I would be happy to talk with anyone about my experience with AvidXchange.-Laurie Kaplin, Sr. Programmer/Analyst (& AvidXchange Administrator)NTS Development Company"
AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Erica,"Wednesday, May 14, 2014","We have been live with Avid for a little over 2 years.  We love it! Having worked with other AP automation software companies, I can attest to the fact that Avid is doing it right.  The customer service is unmatched in the industry.  With any automation, there comes a little leg work getting to the point of going live, but Avid is wonderful in terms of communicating that early and often.   The sales process and implementation process ran as smoothly as I could imagine. It's important to call out that you'll get from Avid whatever you/your team puts into it.  Plan thoughtfully, and the Avid team will walk you through the implementation, step by step. Once you go live, you'll see real results.  We were able to re-dedicate an entire AP person to another role, from which we're benefiting immensely. From beginning to end, the Avid team has been more than available, responsive, and helpful. Thank you, Avid, for helping us use our resources in more efficient ways! "
AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Gary Hess,"Thursday, May 8, 2014","We have been a client of AvidXchange for more than 10 years and are extremely pleased with ther AvidInvoice electronic invoice processing application.

Not only has it eliminated paper but also saved us a large amount of money in overnight fees, paper costs and soft costs involved in employees no longer taking time to find out ""where is my invoice?"".   During the past 10 years they have continued to enhance the product in order to make it more user friendly.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,John,"Wednesday, February 5, 2014","The software did not work as I had anticipated.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Mark Stevens,"Friday, May 10, 2013","What did I just buy? After a long and gruelling sales process with a misleading sales rep, we finally made the jump with avid. To begin, we were promised a 30 day implementation time frame, 60 days later the software was finally set up appropriately. Thankfully the billing didn't begin until after we were live, however, right after, everything turned to complete hell. With major bugs and lots of support tickets things finally started to subside and we were able to fully use the software, three months later. This is when we really found out the lies that were sold to us. With this software we were under the expectation that avid would handle all of our scanning of invoices, even while negotiating the contract we were promised this. False! They will only handle a small percentage. We were also under the impression that avid would automatically push date between our accounting software, mri.  False! You will have to run a report manually, manually export the files, manually important the files into mri, where's the automatic integration? Workflows was a huge deciding factor, previous to avid, we've been burned by invoices being approved by the incorrect individuals. Once again with avid, we were under the assumption, invoices would have to take a predetermined workflow through the entire system. False, the individual coding the invoice must choose the workflow. At the end of the day, Im unsure of what avid actually does for me? I'm still scanning hundreds of invoices, Im still manually putting data into mri, and Im still manually routing invoices for approval. Be wary friends! Make sure you ask questions, and if you don't get a straight forward answer, ask again! Good luck."

Jeff could not resolve the problems and left the site not working and with the fatal error still active so the site could not be seen. obvious he is no good at what he is doing..  I have requested a refund because of there many other issues and lack of quality at this host.. I would not recommend this host save yourself the stress of a low grade host and move on..

Hostoople,www.hostoople.com,Marco Sterling,"Monday, September 29, 2014","Think that it will be useful to share my experience dealing with Hostoople.com. I have also spent so much time looking for good, reliable web hosting provider with advance technology for future. Most of the other provider's email box/account has some kind of limitation so please beware of those top rated provider with basic setup. You will also file some coupon around for additional discount. Their tech support knows what they are doing and can solve issues fast. Any questions I've had have been answered quickly.They also offer 30 minutes a month worth of updates for free. The basic Hostoople plan is $3.95/month, and on some other sites you can get a lot more space and bandwidth. But, of course, some of the other sites that oversell hosting also have terrible service and reliability. So far everything is good...if it changes I will post again but for now I and my friends in the USA are happy."

BannerFlow,www.bannerflow.com,Jack van Metre,"Thursday, November 20, 2014","I wouldn't bother with this product.

Google Analytics,www.google.com/analytics/,James Ketchell,"Saturday, March 16, 2013","We started using google analytics back when it was under its original name of Urchin.  A lot has changed since then, not least with this software. The Good: Its free!  Not many places you can get access to essentially enterprise level software for a zero cost. Infinitely customizable.  There are numerous websites and manuals available which can teach you ways of turning GA into an almost bespoke solution for your business. Google continues to innovate this product on what seems like a weekly basis.  In recent months the push has been heavily towards social media analytics.   The Bad: Steep learning curve for the uninitiated. Bias towards google adwords when it regards advertising tracking. Currently offers relatieve weak mobile analytics.

TeamDesk,Write a review,Michael Ver Duin,"Wednesday, March 9, 2016","The online, cloud based solution that we've created with TeamDesk's database keeps my business running. We use it to track jobs in shop, and reference them in reorders. We aren't even using the system to the fullest extent, but it is nice to know that when we have an idea, the software is there to build what we need.The few times we couldn't, the staff at TeamDesk was responsive and quick with work-arounds or implementations of new code. It isn't exactly 'Programming', but it is. You've got to plan out what you want, and then build it. If you can flow chart your process and are decent with putting together formulas, then this is the software for you.  We started in MS Access, and eventually went online with DabbleDB as we built more and more features into our workflow. When DabbleDB got bought, we looked long and hard for another solution. We didn't 'settle' on TeamDesk, we were excited to move up to their services, functionality, and flexibility. "
PerfectForms,Write a review,Robert Cohen,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","As department Graduate Programs Coordinator with four MS/PhD programs, I use Perfectforms for all graduate admissions (approximately 300 applications a year).  We are completely satisfied.  The program is very flexible, can handle all our needs, and seamlessly collects applications and letters of recommendation for us, including a) notifying us (and the applicant) about materials, and b) requesting letters, all of which we are notified about via email.  I can easily access information prior to our application deadlines, and after deadlines have passed, I can download all the information to Excel so that I can manipulate it in various ways for the faculty. Whenever questions have arisen, especially during the early development of our application, I found the Perfectforms personnel to be extremely helpful and competent.  This product has met or surpassed all our needs and expectations."
PerfectForms,Write a review,Mihir Desai,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","We are avid users of PerfectForms for over 5 years now and the nifty forms service over the cloud continues to meet more and more of our internal business and external client needs.

We have leveraged the workflow capabilities in auditing, reporting and publishing of collected data.  In general the tool could be configured as a fully functional development suite with rich UI and enterprise grade database back end that can fulfill almost any business process re-engineering projects.  Hosted over the cloud allows us to meet high availability SLA's with our end customers.  More so than the service itself - the support is fantastic.  Most of our questions are answered within a business day and a friendly account representative is at hand to arrange for any user training as well as bring in technical folks to the table to collaborate with us on our application designs.

Perfect Forms helped our School District solve our application processing issues.

Perfect Forms not only has allowed us to streamline this application process, but it has dramatically reduced overall time spent to process our Option 2s. Due to Perfect Forms industry leading feature set, we are now looking to move some of our business processing to Perfect Forms.

PerfectForms,Write a review,Mike Abney,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","I've been using PerfectForms since 2007. As the Effectiveness and Efficiency Facilitator, one of my duties is to seek out products and services that will make our processes more effective and efficient.I was introduced to PerfectForms after being tasked with improving the process of enrolling Dual Enrollment Students. These students are still in High School and receive College credit as well as High School credit for a given course.One of the greatest challenges of this use case was its workflow. Parents, Students, High School Counselors, the Dual Enrollment Office, Admissions, the Business Office, and Records all had to be involved in enrolling these students every Fall Semester.With PerfectForms, we took what was a manually routed, paper based process that left parents wondering if they had submitted everything needed, to a fully automated process that is routed via email, incorporated text messaging and email notifications to keep everyone on the same page, and even provided the Counsellors a way to send a High School transcript attached to a PerfectForms paperless but paper-like form. This form included everything that was on a multi-part carbonless form, and even included electronic signatures.Since then we here at UT Martin and even throughout the State of Tennessee University System, have used PerfectForms to empower users to improve their own processes and even create complete solutions by using over 900 forms.PerfectForms to us is a beloved tool that allows the repurposing of time to be spent doing more subjective things, and leaving ""the  paperwork"" in the hands of a perfect process, built by ""the boots on the ground"" using ""perfect forms""."
PerfectForms,Write a review,Heather Baldic,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","The need for PerfectForms came about in 2009. Our company received and processed hundreds of multi-page/multi-copied customer profiles. We were looking for a legally binding digital way for customers to sign off on their profile sheet. PerfectForms was the only company that provided this multi-layered digital approval process that our law team would accept as binding.  We have since created many internal business forms to reduce errors, track budgets, and decrease our environmental footprint. The forms are easy to build with 100% customization.  Our interaction with the sales and support team has also been exceptional. Both our support agent and our account manager are responsive and knowledgeable. I would recommend PerfectForms to ANY business looking to increase productivity, employee accountability, and reduce human errors. "

PerfectForms,Write a review,Dawn Crawford,"Monday, August 11, 2014","Perfect Forms for us started with a need to follow workflow for 2 specific forms; that was two years ago.  Since those 2 initial forms our usage has grown and continues to - I believe we are at 65  forms now.  We have been able to eliminate a great deal of paper, and have complete tracking along the way.  If user 1 submits a form, we can see that it was approved by the next layer, and currently stuck at the final approval.  No more misplaced paper versions.The online form designer is both easy and intuitive.  Creating a new simple form or adjusting workflow can be done in a matter of minutes.  Additional functionality can be easily added along with creating dynamic reports.Customer service at Perfect Forms is truly phenomenal. Both email and phone calls are answered quickly. All in all its a great service!  I cannot say enough good things about Perfect Forms, it has given us the ability to roll out, update, ensure consistency, and track all at once."
PerfectForms,Write a review,T Spencer,"Monday, August 11, 2014",We use Perfect Forms to conduct an annual survey of our member schools regarding standardized test scores. The survey is easy for our schools to complete and the form is easy to update each year. This is a very powerful tool.

Snappii,www.snappii.com,Leo S,"Monday, May 23, 2016","Started working with Snappii for a simple App for our business in November 2015, told that it would take 3-4 weeks to complete. Buyer beware! Please do not use this company if you value your time and money!6 months later, no App, lost my money.Endless back and forth to explain simple concepts that seemed to go without comprehension. Passed through too many employees, several of which do not work for the company any more. Given numerous excuses for why they were not getting back to us (""too much snow"", ""dental problems"") To make a long story short, against our better judgement gave them a second and third chance, and still have no working product and are out our money. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us if you need more convincing to stay away from Snappii!"

My app is now on Apple iTunes and Google Play.Thanks to the Snappii team.  "
GoodBarber,www.goodbarber.com,Nikki Mezic,"Monday, July 18, 2016","Bad platform, extremely difficult for beginners. Help is non-existant,  if you can't find answers in their blog or online help section you're screwed. You can reach out to their live help but they will give you the most basic & slow response (I think they are based in Europe) and direct you to the online help section and blog you've already exhausted looking for answers that aren't there. I inherited an app that was designed in 2014 using html code. They have a new interface where you don't need to know code, unfortunately my old app can't be modified using the new interface so I have to update the code and I do not know html code. Also, you can't delete and app and replace it you have to pay for a new one. Bottom line, GoodBarber is a horrible app builder, hard to use and no help system in place. Best idea would be to pay someone to create your app for you and save yourself the frustrationg and time suck of trying to use this platform."

Zoho,Write a review,Neil Leigh,"Friday, February 6, 2015","I have been using Zoho CRM on and off for several years. I have used it both as a free and paid service (my needs have changed during that time and Zoho lets you up and downgrade as you need). In my opinion, Zoho CRM gives a lot of bang for the buck and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who needs to follow up with customers on a regular basis. Zoho CRM lets you document all relevant information about customers and potential customers, helps you to keep leads in the forefront of your activity, gives plenty of reporting options and additionally has a ton of flexible setup options like adapting the screens to show only the fields you need, changing field names and exporting  data. I have used the export option extensively to get the required mailing info for an external emailer application and it has worked very well.Deserves 5 stars."
Zoho,Write a review,Wayne,"Monday, July 7, 2014","I Have been using the free email and web hosting service.  Until now, I had been perfectly happy with the service.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for - I pay noting and in terms of support to resolve a problem - I have so far got nothing.  Slow responses, useless suggestions and no solution after nearly 2 weeks with the problem.  Don't be a scrooge - pay for a better service.  Can't recommend at all."

CATS,www.catsone.com,LeQuay Marsh,"Friday, June 27, 2014","Let me start by saying that I have been with CATS for the past few years. My experience has been nothing short of excellent. CATS has far more robust features than the other recruitment systems I've explored and/or used. It can be used to manage candidate flow for existing requisitions or to build strategic candidate pipelines for the needs of the future. CATS is easy to customize the system internally to work within your existing recruitment processes. Most of the other tools I've used has required us to create multiple work around processes forcing and even change our internal processes to meet the requirements of the system. This isn't the case with CATS and it only took us an hour or two to set it up.CATS has made various plug-ins available free of charge to its subscribers. These plug-ins allow you to do everything from edit resumes within the system using a Microsoft Word Plug-in, leverage WordPress, and even send LinkedIn profiles and resumes from job boards directly into the CATS system.You can easily move data from other recruiting systems to CATS. You can either upload large batches of resumes or even upload a CSV document  from Excel directly into the system.One of the best features behind CATS is that it is a tool that continues to grow and is always improving. They continue to grow in excellence through the value they place on the feedback from their subscribers. Many of the suggestions recommended by subscribers have been implemented very successfully and relatively quickly.I strongly recommend any organization looking for an extremely robust and customizable recruitment solution to consider CATS. You can even avoid lengthy contracts."
CATS,www.catsone.com,Michael Aubrecht,"Wednesday, June 11, 2014","I've been in the recruiting business for 25 years.  I tried just about every type of recruiting software on the market.

I'm not the most technical person and they make everything easy to understand and use.  They are open to suggestions regarding added features and they're always striving to make their product the best out there.  If you try it, you'll stay forever!"

Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Michael Felix,"Wednesday, May 18, 2016","Owning a CPA firm requires me to maintain a number of accounting applications and their requirements keep varying during and after the tax season. Ease of scalability with the plans of Ace fits best for my needs. The thing that I liked most about them is their support. I simply call them and they do all the changes with plans as per my demands. They do not force the sale or try to misguide me. Often the solution was delivered over live chat. Great job Acecloud."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Lori L,"Monday, April 18, 2016",I was having issues with my QB file and a representative called me right away and was able to resolve the issue on a timely basis.  I am very satisfied with the quality of their service and the quick response.
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Sharon L.,"Wednesday, April 13, 2016","Ace Cloud Hosting is good with hosting and support. I am using their hosting services for different software for accounting including Drake, ATX, QuickBooks, etc. Their plans are cost effective and even the quality of service is fine. Though they offer hosting service for all types of application, their expertise is limited to accounting. That might be their only limitation."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Susan Q. Wilson,"Monday, March 14, 2016","I have been using QB for quite some time now. And  I have gathered through my experiences that one should choose the hosting party very sincerely. Because they are the ones who remain stuck with you later.  Ace Cloud Hosting has done well enough, as much as I can say as a user.  I had switched to them after using another hosting provider.  And it been almost two years now. Except few instances when the server was down.  Their customer support is just great. "
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Bob Ross,"Monday, February 29, 2016","Customer support is the factor for which I will always stay with Ace Cloud Hosting. I have used a couple of different service providers before Ace Cloud Hosting and being technically feeble, I could not get comfortable with the cloud. So, I had to opt for a provider that can offer the convenience with the support. Ace Cloud Hosting is certainly the best of them all. I never found myself waiting for the call to be answered, the support staff is polite and most importantly, resolves my issues effectively. They have been impressing ever since my trial period. Now more than 2 years with them, my issues are lesser in number but their support abilities still keep getting better."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Denise,"Monday, February 8, 2016","I am using the hosting services of Ace Cloud Hosting for QB Pro, Lacerate 2012-15, and MS Office Standard for a fluctuating number of users. Right from pricing to support, Ace has been thoroughly satisfying for all the applications. Its not just me, but all the users working with me find ACHs work appreciable."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Cheval Lewis,"Tuesday, October 27, 2015","These guys are amazing with their services. Downtime was my concern while choosing cloud services, but Ace Cloud Hosting has justified that my decision of choosing them. It has been some years since I am hosting my QuickBooks on their servers and I am yet to face any downtime issue. I have even switched the plans for a greater number of users during the tax seasons. Their effectiveness in delivering that was pretty impressive as well. There have been occasions when I had some issues with the printing, but support staff was able to help me with that. I believe thats acceptable with the technical stuff. The best part is that I never had to wait for the tech support- even during the rush hours. What more can I ask for?"
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Arthur,"Friday, September 25, 2015",I have been using QuickBooks Desktop for 5 years and cant imagine my company running without it. Was a user at other company and their service was satisfactory for the first year. However in the next year it was horrible. The servers were always going down and the support staff was really unhelpful. They just put me on hold saying their technicians are looking into the problem. A colleague told me to switch to Ace Cloud which I did. The setting up and migration of my data was smooth and quick. Even after that they have been really helpful and all the problems that come up are solved instantaneously. The servers run well with hardly any downtime. Excellent service and excellent support. Now that its been 6 months with them I only hope that they maintain their quality of service in future also.
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Anita J Deslauriers,"Monday, September 7, 2015","Hi, I chose AceCloudHosting for QuickBooks hosting almost a year ago and I have to admit that Im really impressed with their services. The setup was pretty fast, which was initiated right after the payment. There have been uptime issues at times. They promised a 99.9% and I think they are just able to maintain that. Support service is more than satisfactory and support guys have always been polite and friendly. Recently I hired a couple of new staff members and they werent all that comfortable with hosted QuickBooks. I will commend Ace Clouds support guys for guiding them pretty well and being patient with them. As a customer, Im more than satisfied with their service. I hope they continue this service quality in future also."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,"Eva Scott, Accountant","Friday, August 14, 2015","The thing that I like most about guys at Ace is they keep things simple and straight. The support person who assisted me was concerned about my requirements. Though he gave me some suggestions with the plan, but he did not force me for upsell.Right from that moment, Ace Cloud has kept adding more to the positive impression. I have hardly faced any issue related with installation, setup, and rest of technical operations. Maybe some minutes of downtime in a year.Its been close to a year since I have been using their services and the only reason for which I had to contact them after the installation was for increasing the users. They did good job even then. It is sometimes surprising that they are continuously able to maintain pretty quick response time."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Melinda Jonson,"Thursday, July 2, 2015","Its been more than 2 years since AceCloudHosting has been hosting QuickBooks for me and I believe that is good enough time to judge a service.Mostly, they have been a little lower with up time than what they promise. But their support guys have supported during the days when I was not well-versed with using QuickBooks, so I dont mind the issue with up time. I have even faced issues with some add-ons sometimes, which can be very frustrating and annoying. Again their technical support has been able to rescue. They are able to fix the things up pretty quickly, which is impressive. So, their service is a mix of some good and some bad.I would not say that they are offering some exceptional services, but they are not bad enough think of other option. Technically, their service may offer some rough patches, which I believe is unavoidable with such services. But their approach always sounds customer-friendly, literally. So, I am going to stay with them for some good time."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Danielle Neidig,"Thursday, May 14, 2015","Almost a week ago, I was not able to access to any service offered by Ace Cloud Hosting. On contacting the customer support, I was informed that services are under some upgrading and it was expected to take another hour for services to reinstate. I was furious to hear this as I had to work on some files urgently. Though I was very rude, the customer support behaved pleasantly. They also suggested me to work offline on the files available in backup till the online services get back in action.Thankfully, the backup they provided was recent and I was able to get the job done well in time. I understand that upgrading actions are unavoidable for such services and Ace Cloud Hosting did the job considerably well. Only lacking I feel is that you guys should have informed me earlier that services will be down during those duration."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Ralph J Wilson CPA,"Friday, April 10, 2015","They are flawless and perfect with their sales ability. I was convinced that Ace Cloud Hosting is the best possible option for me but things did not last that way for long. Setup was initiated and completed in moment after payment. But soon I faced connectivity issues with their service and support team had to get the things repaired. Their up-time issue is usually fine but sometimes turns slow. While working on some urgent needs, this issue seems unbearable.Their overall services are fine enough. I might be criticizing them more because of the high expectations they had set during the sale, but they have not been able lived up to them."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Sean Barhorst,"Thursday, April 2, 2015","I switched to Ace Cloud Hosting, because my previous hosting solution was not providing quality support services. It has been more than 3 months with Ace Cloud Hosting and I am now comfortable using it. However, initial phase with them was not very pleasant and I faced some issues during installation and setup. Sometimes, even minute changes in configuration were causing issues.To be honest, that could well be because I was well adapted to the previous service that I was using. Thankfully, technical support of Ace Cloud Hosting did a more than fine job in assisted well. I appreciate their efficiency. But more than that it was their friendliness because of which I did not switched back to my previous service. Of late, I am able to use this service finely and for most reasons I would recommend using this service."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,"Melinda Smith, CPA","Sunday, March 1, 2015","I have been using Ace services for about a year now.  Their constant effort to satisfy clients is commendable.  They provide you with tailor-made plans that suit your needs.I got in touch with AceCloudHosting last summer and was pleased with the pricing they offered me. I took my time and opted for the starter plan, just to scrutinize the services. I was satisfied with their responsiveness and tech support and took the 1-year subscription. They always keep me updated with all the latest updates of the servers and other heavy applications that I use.However, there are some minor issues that keep coming up. Server updates that are usually done on Sundays, slows down the business process a bit. If they can also change the schedule of updating windows, that would be really helpful. Printing documents becomes a hectic task sometimes, unless Uniprint software is not installed on the server.Above all the working pattern of Ace Cloud Hosting is satisfactory."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Andrei Macsin,"Wednesday, February 18, 2015","Am taking QuickBooks hosting services from Ace from almost 1 year now. There were some server downtime issues initially. Unresolved issues for many days were also a matter of concern for my company. I tried to get in touch with the technical staff and was assured of better performance but nothing much changed.However, now they seem to have improved in those terms. Last week they delivered our 3 servers within 45 minutes.I would still suggest this company for hosting purpose because they still have something better than the others. Their customer service has improved a lot and is professional in handling queries. The security of your private data is dealt with excellence. Login issues are very minimal and the remote access of applications works fine. There is nothing much that is alarming. "
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Lena Woodruff,"Friday, January 30, 2015","I have a small firm and I have been using QuickBooks since 2012. I went into a lot of research for deciding as to who would be the best hosting provider for QuickBooks. Some were bad and some were good but in the end I rooted for AceCloudHosting. The main reason being that their pricing structure is fairly competitive and the way they treat their customer is very satisfying. Great tech support as well, all my issues and queries were promptly resolved. There were some issues related to service interruption few days back..hope it wouldnt happen again."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Kevin Anderson,"Friday, January 16, 2015","I signed up for QuickBooks hosting last year with AceCloudHosting. Setup was performed instantly, right after the payment. I had no issue with their price and support; these guys are very good and responsive. But their servers or data centers are somewhat slow; they are not providing server uptime of 99.9%, as promised. So, based on their service I have received overall positive experience and hope they would keep their promise of server uptime."

The system has worked perfectly and if we ever do have a problem they fix it within minutes - these guys never sleep! QuickBooks runs very quickly (faster than on most local pcs) and it is good to know that there is always a current back up. Highly recommended even if  overseas  - and finally at a great price too.

"Cloudwalk Hosting, LLC",www.cloudwalks.com,William Mitchell,"Monday, December 8, 2014","TapClicks was a startup firm and I've been doing all the accounting.  Initially Quickbooks was on my laptop.  I started to get a bit of accounting help, and so we put the files on Cloudwalk Hosting so that two of us could access Quickbooks.  We don't have  a company network (yet).  Initially, it gave us the safety of daily backups which I was previously doing infrequently.This has been very convenient for us.  Also, I have always found Cloudwalks Hosting to be very responsive whenever issues or problems arise.  I recommend them to anyone looking for additional security knowing your data is backed up daily and for ease in accessing from multiple computers and multiple sites"

Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Edward Culp,"Thursday, November 5, 2015",Elucentra has been a reliable and responsive server for my Quickbooks.  They give extremely quick and successful customer service when I need it!
Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Joe Hopkins,"Tuesday, August 25, 2015","Elucentra by far has a superior service in providing a cloud hosting solution for QuickBooks products among many other solutions. As many people will tell you, the QuickBooks Online solution is convenient and the desktop version of QuickBooks is powerful in its full functionality and reporting capabilities. So..... why not combine the power of both!!! Elucentra provide a conduit to host your QuickBooks desktop licensed software in a secure cloud environment with worry free backup and superfast server rendering. As a matter of fact, I was able to run a 2014 QuickBooks Enterprise connection with my Mac Air laptop using my hotspot connection on my cell phone while sitting in a Home Depot parking lot. If I had any issues, I would typically send Elucentra an email and my problem was resolved within a few minutes. The support staff is friendly & personable. As Chief Financial Officer for multiple companies I worked 1st hand with Elucentra to convert five separate software versions of QuickBooks that resided on 5 different city desktop locations all into one version of QuickBooks Enterprise. We were able to assign user access right for specific individuals to one or more databases as needed.  I am able to view in real time all the accounting data from each location while still giving the localized accounting staff in remote cities the ability to do the daily accounting work. You don't have to be a large organization to reap the benefits of the online server environment. Go ahead and take that Caribbean vacation and login using a remote computer... you deserve a break.  With a little advanced notice they can have a new virtual server spun up for you in a few hours and import your backup QuickBooks file (depending on the size) within another hour or so of sending them the data file. To my knowledge they still support the month to month service commitment. So you can quit anytime, no questions asked. But believe me... once your on.... there will be no reason to get off. You will have a few questions during the first couple of weeks such as setting up the simple slave printers & setting up the invoice & reporting email system to use your current email server. Other than that it is a very simplistic and user friendly experience. Good luck on your remote number crunching in the mean time!"
Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Dustin Holzberger,"Sunday, March 1, 2015","I searched for a solution for hosting my QuickBooks Enterprise Edition for the past few years but for the money it just did not seem to make good fiscal sense.  Plus there always seem to be ad on services that kept pushing the price further out of reach.  Today, I have Elucentra Cloud Services.  Its twice as fast as when I had QuickBooks on my own network and the staff has all been Johnny on the spot with any questions or need I have.  Excel was included and it works with my hosted tax solution called Avalara.  Great solution and I could not be happier."

Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Audrey,"Friday, October 17, 2014","I just wanted to take a moment to share with you my experience with Elucentra.  We are a small business with only a few employees; however, our employees do not work in the same location.  We were transferring accounting files back and forth and sometimes would get it wrong and end up sending or updating an old version and then we'd have to redo everything.  I was looking for a means of everyone having access and being able to work in the same data files at all times.  It had to be accessible 24/7 not only for the data but also for support.  When I came across Elucentra and you advertised 24/7/365 support via live chat and very little down time, I was skeptical.  It ""felt"" expensive for us since we are small, but thought I would give it a try.  I have been so thankful that I did. I cannot tell you the peace of mind I have knowing everyone's in the same files and that when I am up and working at 3 a.m. or on the weekends, I don't have to worry with whether I have the latest information and knowing any changes I make my employees also have access to.  Your customer support has been outstanding.  I have literally chatted with people at 3 a.m. and on weekends....all hours... and someone is always quick to respond and solve whatever issues I may be experiencing (many of which are just my lack of understanding...not really software issues).  You have an outstanding staff and product.  I would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone and  have already done so."

After 3   weeks of trying to get my sites working on their system with NO help what-so-ever, I was finally forced to move to Go Daddy. Now they have the nerve to continue to bill me for 'services' which had I received I would not have left. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE! THEY HAVE PROVEN THEY DON'T DESERVE IT!"

They just put me on hold saying their technicians are looking into the problem. A colleague recommended Hitech Cloud to me. The setting up and migration of my data was smooth and quick. Even after that they have been really helpful and all the problems that come up are solved instantaneously. The servers run well with hardly any downtime. It has been excellent working with them so far. Now that its been 6 months with them I only hope that they maintain their quality of service in future also.

Superb did this the other week. I was out of town and my server went down for something I did. Superb was monitoring my server, so I received an email and text telling me. 20 minutes later I got a call from a data center from their team who helped me get back online without me having to do anything.

We wanted to add about 150 users, so we would be a big account and assumed customer service would be stellar. We couldnt have been more wrong. From the sales staff to technical support, they were horrible, demanding, and condescending. Our service rep Bill acted more like a used car salesman than a professional. What Lisa from DeleGates review said was correct, your feel like they are doing you a favor. If you dont respond to a voice mail, or dont reply to an email within a couple of days, youll get scolded and patronized. I think they forget they need the customers more than customers need them. Unfortunately were still looking for a similar service, any recommendations? This is a classic non-customer focused company!"

In fact the exact words were 'if you cannot make a future call, it is imperative that you let us know ahead of time.  We have many other customer appointments scheduled throughout the day, and a no show throws our schedule off....'We had hoped after reading reviews to go ahead with TrackVia and get a good working relationship with them as we have many customers who will in time be requiring their services/system."

I have used Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Google Drive, and Sheets. The only app I have yet to try is Slideshow. But all office product applications are as good or better than any Microsoft brand office software. The absolutely best part of Google, was their pioneering mainstreaming of cloud based storage for all these applications. And their pioneering offer of amazingly large data storage amounts. The Gigabytes of memory that Google has offered through their products was unbelievably larger compared to paid competitors. The ease and security of Google has always made using these applications feel safe and secure for any professional use of their applications.   "

Even better, our customers like it as they dont have to call in or coordinate coming in by email. Instead, they just go online and book their appointment.

Obviously the company does not care about customers based on the reviews.  Sad!  
Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,Kiki,"Monday, June 1, 2015","I used to love Appointment Plus but now the website is ridiculous. The home page is just juvenile, with the fat man dancing on the front and the 'chat' pop up that takes forever to open. All of the ridiculous add-ons and videos take time to load, precious time that I could be working. Thankfully, the iPhone app doesn't have all of that crap on it but it also detracts from my copy-and-paste abilities and I have to type out phone numbers.

Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,Dan Griffin,"Friday, January 16, 2015","I never write reviews, i took the time to write this one because nobody should have to go through having to deal with appointment plus. i have been using this website for about 2 years and ive seen a constant 1-star level of service.Pros: -its cheap for the basic serviceCons: -poor customer service-when entering information in the customer info page, if you enter more data than the field is capable of handling and submit changes, it will report that the data have been recorded successfully but it will get cut off-site frequently slows to a crawl for 15min to an hour, or even stops working completely-a problem with the site (appointments not appearing in month view) was brought to their attention and took 3 months to get fixed-the document upload feature costs $1 per MB per month... ill say it again.... $1 / PER MEGABYTE / PER MONTH! (dropbox is the equivalent of $1 / per YEAR / per 1048576 megabytes)-there are tons of arbitrary rules that dont make any sense, for example only 3 customer notes will appear in an appointment window, even if you have more than 3 customer notes-scheduling interface is hard to use, not hard to understand, but hard to physically use, if you change certain data fields like service, it will default all of your other settings to default, if you dont change the settings in the correct order-exporting reports to excel will obfuscate data fields, customer data rows will not line up with their respective columns. this was brought to their attention and i was told i was to blame, that there was a setting in my excel program that was causing the data to be delimited, no such setting exists-they refuse to provide you with a copy of your data. not even a database file. they tell you to export your data using the reports feature but NOT ALL OF YOUR DATA FIELDS ARE EXPORTABLE. when brought to their attention they did nothing about itso please, stay away from this program, unless you are a small mom and pop shop that has maybe 5-10 customers a week and cant afford the larger CRM subscriptions, and even then, know that you cannot retreive all of your data-Dan"

Their training department got me up and going pretty quick (although Im pretty sure I could have figured it out on my own, but since the set-up was free, what the heck). Whole thing has been working great and I have no complaints. My customers are happy and the monthly cost is low. Win-win for me."

Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,MM,"Thursday, February 6, 2014",I have had appointment plus since 2005. My business experienced a major loss in 2007 when all my customer information was overwritten by one customers information. App plus stated it was a very unlikely human error on their part and that the backups at their site were also corrupted so there was no way to retrieve information. I was given 3 months of service free and since then make my own backups regularly. Seemed to have a run of years with no problems and a reliable connection. Ever since mid-late 2013 something has gone horribly WRONG with App Plus!! The site is completely unreliable. I am embarrassed when I have to make clients stand and wait to book their next appointment or when we receive calls and have to ask them to bear with us as the site isn't working or is so slow. It has definitely caused me to provide poor customer service and I cannot even quantify the loss I experienced from the 2007 incident. Seriously considering searching for a new web based appointment company. I am extremely forgiving and will stick with something far too long when I know its not working. But I do get to the point when I know enough is enough. I am definitely there!

I've had to call the sales dept and even they sound frustrated. Their technical team is missing a beat, as well. New releases come without any warning and never seem to work right. Just today something happened to prevent some major functionality (typing in a customer's last name) isn't working properly. Argh! We will have to start looking for a replacement.

Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,Deana Sellens,"Monday, January 13, 2014","When we first signed on with them, the system worked well. They did an ""enhancement"" and our appointments and customer records began duplicating. We complained for 3 months with no resolution. We even had been paying extra for tech support. We finally had to cancel the service about a month ago. They disabled our employee logins, but some of our customers had the appointment page bookmarked. The system continued to take appointments after we cancelled. We started having customers show up with confirmation emails but all of our kennels were full. It is almost impossible to get a live person on the phone to fix it. When you finally do, they argue with you. I do not wish Appointment-Plus on my worst enemies."

This issue went unresolved and my messages were not responded to for TWO WEEKS. This is what the company does...take reservations...and we couldn't do that for two weeks.

You have to open a ticket which takes at least a day for the response.

Sarah identified the problem as a system issue and immediately suggested a potential workaround. Not only did she suggest it, but she then logged into my account and made the changes, showed me the changes, and we were all set.

Timely,www.gettimely.com/,K. jensen ,"Monday, February 15, 2016",I have searched all over the Internet for a great online booking software for my mobile company. Mobile Beauty Team is so happy to finally have a program that works so well and is very easy to use.I love seeing all the new updates and o can't wait to see the Android /Windows App ( currently only available for iPhone users) My team loves this program as well thanks Timley 
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,Heather White,"Friday, January 15, 2016","We found Timely after already investing in another salon system. Unfortunately it became clear very quickly that it just wouldn't work for us, so we did some research and Timely kept popping up. We spoke to the fabulous Neil in the London office and we were up and running in two days. Their proactive approach to functionality, communication and all round client service is second to none. The information we have at our finger tips is relevant, the system is intuitive to use and has features that we simply could not do without now. We ? Timely! "
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,Charles Clarke,"Wednesday, January 13, 2016","I have used a few other systems in my salon but they were costly, kept freezing and just didn't give me the control of my business that they claimed. I found timely and have not looked back! Fantastic system, easy to use, has all the features of other systems and more, is a fraction of the cost and has no contracts!Interested? Make sure to tell them I sent you! Oh, and you can sell gift vouchers on your website too with timely! :)"
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,David,"Tuesday, January 12, 2016","Timely makes running my business easy! It's beautiful and simple to use (by far the easiest I've had). They have great support staff, who are friendly and really helpful. I also like that they're always adding new stuff like features that we've voted on! Timely has been a real lifesaver!"
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Louise Rose,"Monday, March 9, 2015","I subscribed to BookmyCity online booking about 2 months ago.  The technicians Nicole and Heather were wonderful, but the program itself is very cumbersome.  Their technical support group is very slow at making changes.   You cannot change an appointment time or reschedule without deleting and re-adding.  The company I am with now, you simply edit the time or grab and move it with the mouse.  When an employee wants a  period off, it was a very difficult process.  My clients that were booking were not able to book   After about 2 weeks of constant chats and phone calls, they discovered there was a ""bug"" in the system.   Therefore I would not recommend this company for an easy software service for your clients to book online   It was  far more work than our simple manual spreadsheet that we had last year.  "
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Lucas,"Wednesday, November 5, 2014","I've received such positive feedback from my clients since joining BookMyCity. They love having the option of booking online, which helps me out too because it's saving me time. It stores all of their info for me which has really improved my customer service."
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Trumell Duncan,"Wednesday, November 5, 2014","BookMyCity support team helped me set up my account, migrate all of my bookings/client data, and taught me how to use the system. I hardly had to do any work. It's been a pretty painless process so far!"
ServiceCEO,www.serviceceo.com,Bob,"Friday, July 31, 2015",Worst site ever. Been on hold for 15 mins with no human  to talk to. Software is beyond slow and unreliable. I want out of my contract so bad. To have to ask a client to sit and wait while you are trying to just load a new webpage on ServiceCeo. WORST COMPANY EVER!
ServiceCEO,www.serviceceo.com,Martin Thirlwell,"Tuesday, March 3, 2015","This product was excellent to start with our corporate office recommended  it and it was great.  However in the passed 12 months it has become slow and unreliable, they insist they are trying to correct it but we have been waiting 5 months and still it is slow, specifically when searching the database.  Still a good product but too slow, we have been using this system for 3 years but I am not sure how much longer we can put up with the lack of progress."

WorkWave Fleet,www.workwave.com,Nan Ma,"Monday, June 1, 2015","Viamente is a very user friendly and easy to pick up tool. Compared with different routing tools we used in the past, Viamente is much simpler but as same powerful. Lot of times, it just can generate more efficient routes. I like almost all features of it. I can use it to solve different types of routing problems, ie. pick up and delivery, build existing, multiple depots, balance work across a week, collect bigger loads using its importance function, different vehicle types, traffic profile, speed factor, drag and drop, change comparison, etc. You can use Viamente just anywhere where you have internet, there is no software installation required. I can work with company computer or work at home, just anywhere. The Viamente team is very service oriented, responsible and expert in this area. We enjoy this software just from all angles."
WorkWave Fleet,www.workwave.com,John Vestus,"Wednesday, November 13, 2013","Viamente is a lifesaver product. Before using it myself, I found my schedule packed and exhausting. After using it and letting it organize my routes, I have more free time than I ever imagined. A must have for anyone."
10to8,www.10to8.com,Sam Deeks,"Friday, February 12, 2016","Comments: The 10to8 software is a fantastic tool for anyone who has customers who have appointments with you and your business. The online diary works really well enabling customers to choose their own time to see you without the hassle of speaking to anyone. My booking page is linked directly to my website making booking simple. Every customer that visits my practice compliment us on our professionalism when it comes to good communication with them. All my customers are contacted at least twice before they actually visit our premises, once to confirm their appointment then a day before their appointment they will receive another text/e mail to remind them of their visit to us. This cuts down on the amount of patients that do not turn up on their allotted sessions. More often than not patients just forget. This is now a thing of the past. We also like the fact that 10to8 is linked to our social media pages. This helps us to promote our business in many ways."

"Roadnet Technologies, Inc",www.roadnet.com ,Dave,"Monday, July 4, 2016","Our company switched to Roadnet a while ago. What a joke. Same stops every week, but it gets run in a different sequence every week.  If the first initial week was supposed to be the most efficient and shortest way, why is being run a different way again and again? Customers are getting upset because our drivers are showing up at different times each week. Our company has let the drivers that run the routes make changes to the roadnet schedule. They have decreased miles and run time. "

Could not have done it without this system. Now running 5 schools and 8 instructors and growing every day. Booked solid 90 days in advance- everyone prepays. PayPal loves us. Don't ever change. You would put me out of business. Don't tell my competitors!

At this point I can give a good review. My site has been up and running constantly and the speed seems to be good. I've written technical support a few times regarding non-urgent matters (questions about how to white-list emails etc..) and each time I got a reply within a few hours. I find communication to be one of the most important things so I gave them 5 stars because of it. The 'pros' for me are: price, the easy to use control panel, and the quick replies.As for the 'cons' there really hasn't been any. At first I didn't  like their email server but once I understood settings could be made in the control panel - it was problem solved."

A fact to tell you is they are a really helpful company who can help you get the best out of the hosting plans. Their customer care service simply rocks. Support is the best thing about this company. Getting a great service from them is a pleasure indeed. The panel is also good for setting up your websites. Now they also support ASP.NET 4.5 which is a great thing as very few hosting providers have support for it (currently). I give my 5 stars to this company!

ASPHostCentral.com,www.asphostcentral.com,Marcus P,"Monday, October 12, 2015","I purposely spend a bit of my time here to write a small review about this host. This is based on my 2-years experience with them. I run a small e-store using nopCommerce and at that time, I really found difficulties finding a decent host that supports nopCommerce. Most of the hosts out there support a PHP-based ecommerce store and luckily, I can find this host for supporting my asp.net ecommerce store. I signed up and my site was up in just 4 hours. I then started to upload my products to their server and I can tell that I did not experience any issue with it. After a few months, sometimes, I can see slight issues with site performance and after speaking with their team, they advise me to upgrade to their business plan. Now,  nearly 2 years later, I never experience any issue any longer. Hope this will continue to work fine as usual."

Didn't respond to our trouble tickets that we posted when their site itself wasn't down. Then, after transferring all our assets to a more professional hosting company, we post a trouble ticket saying we want to cancel our service and they responded right away.

As Director of Digital Marketing for a multiple hospital health care system, this platform allowed our creative and marketing teams to bring all photos and videos under one easy-to-use roof. The assets are searchable and we are able to train our internal and external clients to self-serve, which puts a lot more of our valuable time back in our hands. "
MediaValet,Write a review,Adele Kozlowski,"Monday, December 7, 2015","After having trials with other brands it was clear to us who had the better product and just so happened to be within budget. MediaValet has been incredible, during our decision process, we didn't feel pressure to close the deal or ""hurry up"". We were walked through all areas and even had great customer support during our trial with Sanjay. After moving forward with MediaValet, Raja, and Rob have been incredible. Rob has helped us through every step of implementation and has taken the overwhelming task of transferring our data from an FTP site and renaming items, to making it a feasible task that has been faster than expected. The support we receive on a weekly basis during our weekly phone call for implementation has exceeded my expectations. They truly care about the customer and their product is  easy to use, intuitive for all user levels (which is something we needed), has unlimited users and are transparent. We believed so much in their product that we signed a 2 year agreement and will most likely continue our relationship with them. After running trials with other DAMS with more ""add-ons"" I was running into issues with the site actually working. With MediaValet it was consistent, no down time, errors, and as an admin, uploading more than half a TB onto their cloud has been smooth. Best DAM system out there."
MediaValet,Write a review,Mark wesling,"Friday, May 2, 2014","Excellent DAMS, what separate's them from the pack is the personal touch they have with their clients.

Their website tells me that the transaction is complete, however I haven't received my funds yet. I keep writing to them and all i get is the ""wait alittle more"" response. I am very displeased with their service. I write to you as a warning. For the sake of your sanity and you money, DO NOT DEPOSIT or WITHDRAW any money into this service! They will flat out rob you. I have read the warning from other people and didn't listen. But the warning is REAL. DON'T MESS WITH THESE GUYS, THEY WILL ROB YOU. If you want details, I will give you all the details you need. HEED MY WARNING!! These people kidnap and rape your bitcoins. They are low level shady bottom feeders. They don't care about you the only take your money and give you the finger. I got raped by these scumbags for $1000.

They debited my account immediately but I had to wait 7 days for my BTCs. In that time the price went up 80%. Coinbase then canceled my transaction at the last moment because they said it, was 'high risk.' So in fact, Coinbase used my money to buy BTC, rode the price up, then canceled the transaction, keeping the profit. Nice work if you can get it."

StarChapter,Write a review,Kelly Sweeten,"Thursday, August 11, 2016","     Our chapter had been struggling with trying to maintain a Joomla website and hosting service. The decision was made to look for alternative solutions. Looking at other various PMI chapters webstie, Starchapter was seen as a service most commonly being used. A Google search for Startchapter Reviews showed positive reviews by PMI chapter presidents. An attempt was made to reach out to a Chapter President to verify the review which resulted in a verification of the review by that Chapter President.       Our experience with the transition has been equal to the reviews seen online. Starchapter worked with our technical team to gather requirements, setup an initial design, test the site, and then go live. All this within 6 weeks. We transitioned to the new site in the middle of the month just before a breakfast meeting. No major issues were identified. Although not required, we had limited reach back to our Starchapter project manager during our first week which helped with a few important issues that came up. Since then, we use the Ticket support process and have had all our minor to major issues resolved in a timely manner.       Any chapter of PMI, or other NPOs looking to offload hosting management and Content Management Software (CMS) to another organization should give Starchapter serious consideration. Time our members have to volunteer is a limited resource to manage and prioritize. Starchapters services allows us to put our resources and time into planning strategic growth which would have normally been spent working on technical issues related to hosting services or CMS.      Thank you Starchapter for a great team of people who helped make our transition seamless and without interruption to our chapters services.  v/rKelly Sweeten, PMP Director of Communications, PMI North Alabama Chapter"

Their ticket system raises the bar as far as quality and promptness of service.The only thing keeping them from 5 stars is their ability to adapt and evolve the product per requests from chapters.

My very preliminary assessment is StarChapter is a very good application and support, whether classes or via chat, is excellent. I am trying figure out if StarChapter can replace eStudio. The only feature that StarChapter seems to lack is a document repository. If someone could let me know if StarChapter can replace eStudio entirely and if not, what features are lacking so I can make other accommodations such as using Google Forms for documents, I would appreciate it.

Our StarChapter rep not only listened tirelessly to our ideas and answered questions, she came up with terrific suggestions and implementations that solved problems and enhanced our delivery of our mission statement.

AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,Phil Bonzjeksy,"Wednesday, June 8, 2016",AutoRepair Cloud is simple and useful application for auto repair shop. Its a good application with all necessary functions to run auto repair shop. I tried several automotive software in my shop but this one is really useful. There is a special mobile application for my customers which gives more options to communicate.  
AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,David Thiruman,"Tuesday, June 7, 2016","Its fairly easy to use, many helpful features, good customer service. Auto repair cloud has a lot of features for its price, e.g. labor estimates, auarts management, appointments schedule etc.Though some features missing / configuration is not flexible enough, for example unable to change options on invoices.Altogether I do like the software better than the one I used before, because it has much more features and I would definitely recommend it to others"
Wasp Barcode Technologies,www.waspbarcode.com,Ashley,"Tuesday, May 27, 2014",This gadget is one in a million their whole software line I would highly recommend especially to anyone running a store of and sort.
Wasp Barcode Technologies,www.waspbarcode.com,lB,"Monday, September 16, 2013","This was a good product for barcode software, I never experienced any problems or mistakes with the barcodes. They also offer inventory software that keeps track of the number of items available and alerts when they are out of stock. I would recommend to businesses both big and small. "
Tracker Products,www.trackerproducts.com,Greg C,"Monday, March 31, 2014",The Tracker line of products allow a small business owner to capture critical signatures and track documents. All of the Tracker software is customizable. Now everything gets tracked and works right on my tablet.
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Sunny Sethi,"Tuesday, June 14, 2016",We have been working with EaseCentral for a year now. It was a great decision to move. The customer service from EC team has been awesome. We moved because we needed a user friendly system. The old system we had was hard to navigate and also was difficult to maintain rates.EC has a great Rate Library that makes it easy for us to build a new group in the system quickly. They do update the rates on that so it makes life much easier for us. We hope they will soon add a COBRA providers so the termination information can be sent to the COBRA admin quickly.  We like the fact that they keep adding new features and the system capabilities are increasing every month.Overall we have been very happy with EaseCentral.
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Jodi Hansen,"Thursday, June 2, 2016","Marc Jacobson & Associates has been using EaseCentral for over 5 years.   Our job is to make sure the financial security of our clients and their employees is set, and everything we do supports that, or we dont do it.  EaseCentral supports it!  We have watched it metamorphosed into an incredible tool that we use with over 150 clients on a daily basis.  Our clients and employees love it for the ease and accessibility nationwide.  The team of engineers and staff are fantastic to work with and are constantly producing webinars and other tools.  The customer service is outstanding!  We are looking forward to the integration of the payroll platform and new features that come every quarter!  Great product!"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Bradley Vaccaro,"Wednesday, June 1, 2016","I think the most accurate rating here is 4.5 stars. I researched numerous alternatives to provide online benefits enrollment to Allpointe's clients, and EaseCentral was the most flexible and provided the best value. The half-star dock would be for the lack of full integration with payroll and other platforms. But I rounded up because every single month for the last year, EaseCentral has added and improved features to improve the experience for the broker, client admins and employees... with many more on the way. We have about 35 clients on the portal, and are adding more on a regular basis."
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Danny Firestone,"Thursday, May 26, 2016","We've worked with Ease Central since 9/2015. They have delivered exactly what was promised. The ability for our team to quickly install a case within a couple of days, VS months with other vendors has given us the edge to win cases immediately. We love the fact that we can customize the system on the fly rather than sending out a ticket and waiting for our CSR's from other company's to get to it when we arrive in their queues. When we've encountered issues or needed support, we not only got quick responses, but the EC team has even implemented changes that we recognized were needed for us and our fellow agents. This is the BEST bang for your buck that you will find. We can't speak highly enough of the Ease Central system and the team that supports it. I've even gotten calls from our support rep when she was in a taxi on her way home from the airport at 9pm. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Steve Vilas,"Thursday, May 26, 2016","We've worked with Ease Central for nearly a year now and have nearly 40 clients using the platform.  We've found it easy to set-up, and it's very easy for employees to use.  Ease Central has done an excellent job of putting together a strong support team, and is consistently adding features and tools to make the system more comprehensive and easier to use.  It doesn't do everything - integrations/feeds are still a work in process - but Ease Central is truly one of the easiest systems - and best values - one can offer clients"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Harry Gousha,"Thursday, February 25, 2016","I have had EaseCentral for a couple of months and it is very broker intensive, with brokers doing most of the work.  EaseCentral is not at all intuitive and necessitates hours of study, listening to videos and asking questions.  I am currently try to do a look-back measurement period for ACA - so my client can do the necessary reporting and we are struggling with how to date the start of the measurement period in 2015.  Just one of many issues.  I must say that their support team is outstanding, at least in their efforts to resolve my many issues."
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Dave Ferreira,"Monday, June 20, 2016",Tower Watson conducts business in a very profitable way for themself. They basically are a company that if people had a choice would never do business with them.Can we start a class action suit against this company?How does one go about this course of action?
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Christopher Faraci,"Monday, June 13, 2016","A bunch of well-coached thieves and liars who don't make their payments on time but have mastered the art of being rude, disingenuous and unresponsive when being contacted for a resolution of same.  In a more perfect world a company like this would be shut down "
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Frederick Prip,"Tuesday, April 5, 2016",The worst and most Irresponsible company I have ever dealt with. I am 82 years old and depend on my reimbursement payment...Employees are untrained and unable to answer simple questions... AGILENT..please help resolve this so longterm old employees can get their deserved benefits!
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Russ Rathjen,"Wednesday, March 23, 2016","Towers Watson is an awful company. Untrained and uneducated customer service representatives. But it is not the employees fault that Towers Watson is such a terrible company.....it is Towers Watson executives who make decisions to NOT help customers, especially with reimbursements. State insurance commissioners from every state should go to Towers Watson offices in Utah and Texas and shut them down until they learn how to run a business."
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,sam,"Wednesday, December 17, 2014",I wouldn't trust my dog with Tower Watson. 
AnyPerk,www.anyperk.com,Steve Hogans,"Monday, October 21, 2013","Easy to use perks, great design and analytics. Powerful perks than any other platform."
AnyPerk,www.anyperk.com,A happy customer,"Friday, October 18, 2013","Clean and easy-to-use platform! Lots of perks and steep discounts. They're also rolling out new features every couple of weeks to accompany the perks, making it an awesome platform. Highly recommend!"
InfinityHR,www.infinity-ss.com,Andrew,"Wednesday, March 5, 2014",So I just started with PRMI which is a great company but they use InfinityHR for their benefits.  I looked at the different plans and printed the benefit summary for the plan I signed up for.  Now that my coverage is active I called UnitedHealthCare before making appointments and I found out some of the information in the benefit summary from InfinityHR is incorrect.  Now I have to lookup what I actually signed up for through the UHC website which is ridiculous.  I worked for an insurance company for 10 years prior to this and I don't see how a company who is paid strictly to manage another companies benefits can't get it right.  It shows a major lack of competence.
InfinityHR,www.infinity-ss.com,Kirk Davis,"Thursday, November 21, 2013",We decided to use Infinity HR to help manage our benefits last year.  I have been more than pleased with their performance.  Our benefits administration is in much better shape now and Infinity's services have proven to be very well priced.
Benaissance,www.benaissance.com,State Based Exchange Exec,"Tuesday, March 19, 2013","Strong company, with talented team who fulfilled their promises to implement.  Worthy of proof of concept and validation."
