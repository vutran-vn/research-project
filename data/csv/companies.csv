Log time, create timesheets and simply associate them with your clients in Zoho CRM.  Customize Forms  Fortunately, with Zoho People you dont have to get into code to customize this service to your needs. There are pre-build forms that your HR/Recruitment/Intranet team would usually ask for. If the need arises, you can just just drag & drop of fields & few clicks to edit properties.  Intelligent Automation  As a HR specialist you usually have to interact with multiple entities of the organization to complete a business process like ""new employee"" process. These processes are normally time consuming since they include communication with different entities and the tracking of multiple tasks. With Zoho People's automation tools - checklists, approvals, worflows and reminders you can complete processes like these seamlessly.  Employee Portal & Self-service  Zoho People provides your HR team with important HRIS details. Pre-built HRIS forms make your HR administrative tasks faster and you can focus on resolving important people related issues. Get rid of multiple spreadsheets and maintain all your HRIS data in only one place. Managers and employees are enabled to handle their data on their own through self service. This increases data accuracy, decreases administrative hassles & lessens mundane paper work for you."
