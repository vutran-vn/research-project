If the need arises, you can just just drag & drop of fields & few clicks to edit properties.  Intelligent Automation  As a HR specialist you usually have to interact with multiple entities of the organization to complete a business process like ""new employee"" process. These processes are normally time consuming since they include communication with different entities and the tracking of multiple tasks. With Zoho People's automation tools - checklists, approvals, worflows and reminders you can complete processes like these seamlessly.  Employee Portal & Self-service  Zoho People provides your HR team with important HRIS details. Pre-built HRIS forms make your HR administrative tasks faster and you can focus on resolving important people related issues.

Maximize the feedback that your team gets by installing a large visible display. Why is it needed? Tracking metrics is essential for successful project delivery as it enables you to foresee any possible issues so that you can take action proactively, rather than do firefighting later. Who is it for? The screens improve communication between all stakeholders in Agile development including Scrum masters, developers, Product owner, QA, and even the customer. What makes it stand out from the crowd? We have designed our dashboard for a narrow target group i.e. agile teams, whose needs are not properly covered with the current solutions on the market (due to their nature as platforms rather than out-of-the-box-solutions, they are not built to serve the needs of software developers specifically). Another differentiator is that were focusing on large visible screens and our content is designed to meet that specific use case. Whats you plans for the future? Well be launching our product as a SaaS service, which our customers can self-provision through our website. Well be also adding new integrations with not only task management tools but also for test and build tools for example. We want to provide comprehensive view for the application development lifecycle."

The most up-to-date version of the presentation, who is in or out of the office, the latest corporate announcement regarding the office kitchen, instructions to set up Outlook on your new iPhone or even a quick way to ask a question to an entire department. And all of that could look like a custom-built solution, adapted to look like you and fit the way you work, whether it's by team, departments or offices. Whether you prefer top-down or bottom-up communications. Whether you want an organized structure for your knowledge base or you prefer to let users rely on search. Whether you want to switch off your current knowledge management solution or need to add to it and integrate it into a corporate communications portal.

This tight integration allows marketing and sales processes to communicate, interact, and share information for more effective, targeted, and responsive marketing and sales.  MARKETING AUTOMATION: Our automation builder can begin fully automated processes you define based on a wide variety of triggers including behaviors such as page views and email opens. By combining triggers with actions and conditions, you can automatically begin chains of events that create powerful, personalized marketing experiences for your contacts, manage and organize your list, and more. Customers frequently remark that our automation builder is a pleasure to use, and the flowchart organization of automation workflows is easy to work with, organize, and understand. Our platform allows you to use behavioral data to create marketing that responds and adapts to contacts as they interact with marketing assets. For instance, our Site Tracking feature allows ActiveCampaign to see what a contact is doing on your website and respond in real-time to that behavior. When a contact views a certain product page they could be tagged as interested, they could be sent an email with a discount for that product, or you could automatically follow up with them to see if they have any questions about that product. EMAIL MARKETING: Weve been perfecting our email marketing since 2003. Today it is one of the most mature and fully developed email marketing services on the market. We offer many professionally-designed, 100% mobile responsive email templates. All plans include free image hosting, advanced split testing, automated RSS to email sending, and a powerful drag and drop email builder. We include unlimited sending for most accounts. Youll experience some of the highest deliverability in the industry because we go to great lengths to protect the reputation of our sending servers. Youll be able to dynamically customize the content you send so that contacts receive different messages depending on the web pages theyve viewed, how theyve been tagged, demographic information, custom fields youve created, and more. This way you can alter a message to more closely match a contacts interests. When your offer matches a contacts interests, youll experience higher conversions. Youll be able to use segmentation to create very granular groups of contacts. When your messages precisely match the interests of your contacts, your deliverability will improve, and your list will become more responsive. AUTOMATED SALES CRM: Our CRM utilizes an intuitive drag-and-drop bucket paradigm with each bucket representing a stage of your sales funnel. It is fully customizable so it will adapt to the needs of any business. You can automatically move deals through different stages using the same triggers, conditions, and data you can use within automations so you could, for instance, move a deal to another stage based on whether they responded to email, viewed a web page, performed an event on your website (such as logging in), and more. We offer a flexible lead scoring system that allows you to score deals or contacts. These scores can be used to move deals through your funnel and prioritize your leads on the basis of fit and engagement. ENTERPRISE: ActiveCampaign is an enterprise grade marketing platform that easily scales to any size organization. Our Enterprise tier offers unlimited users, one-on-one support, an uptime Service Level Agreement, and advanced customization options so your organization can white label everything from the interface to the sending servers. Youll also receive priority support and training for your entire team so you can get going quickly. Weve focused on creating an app that is feature-rich and powerful, but at the same time elegant and easy-to-use with a gentle learning curve. We offer a free, no credit card needed, 14-day trial so you can experience ActiveCampaign first hand."

This creates a Single, enhanced view of every single customer. This enhanced data becomes operationalised through connections with communication channels such as email, Facebook or customer service. And the service wrapper that goes around all of this helps clients ensure theyre getting maximum use of the system.  Why does rais exist?Competition in retail is getting fiercer. It's becoming harder to keep hold of customers and find new ones who will be valuable over the long term. Its even harder to do this as a small, understaffed, busy online retailer, who might not have a data management and analytics background. So rais helps these businesses harness their data to convert more customers, more easily at each point in their customer lifecycle. It also helps them understand what activity has worked or not and what to do next to continuously improve conversion rates. "

Users can apply this data and information to the development and management of multidimensional strategies that are delivered over time to achieve sustained, measurable impact. Automated Gantt charts allow you to manage your programs and services, assign due dates and actions, and link efforts to overall strategy. Customizable Strategy maps allow you to create a clear line of sight between individual efforts, partnerships, and high-level goals.

Our ""Turn-the-Curve"" tutorial and scorecard view will guide you step-by-step through a disciplined process for improving your performance measures, allowing you to get from talk to action quickly and maximize your impact. Results Scorecard software is the only software counterpart to the Results-Based Accountability (RBA) framework for decision-making, and it is used by many organizations that also use RBA. But, if you dont use RBA, no problem! Results Scorecard has a methodology-neutral design and the language is customizable to easily fit your performance management needs."

Alpha Beta Commerce,www.alphabetacommerce.com,,Ecommerce Hosting,"Built with modern features and integrations, Alpha Beta Commerce is the first host to provide a robust environment for merchants who want to use WooCommerce but dont want to manage their own ecommerce technology infrastructure. By selecting one of the Alpha Beta Commerce plans, retailers have access to a number of features:  Flexible infrastructure for merchants and their designers  The themes are all built on a solid framework, from Hybrid Code and Underscores. Both code bases are well-structured and optimized. Merchants have to worry less about their developer following best coding practices. Build your own features  One of the hallmarks of the Alpha Beta Commerce platform is the merchants ability to create new functions and features, something not available on BigCommerce and Shopify. Because developers have child theme PHP functions access, they can build on top of any feature and create new features specifically for clients. Seamless and simple customization  Retailers will be able to customize the look and feel of their storefront in real time  including font and color palettes, branding, featured and top-selling collections, social media icons, and more. Developer support  Retailers have two places where they can receive support. Our internal support forum provides merchants with the help and answers they need to successfully run their ecommerce business. Merchants can also choose one of our development partners, or they can even bring their own in to help run their ecommerce business."

Facebook friends secretly unsubscribe from entrepreneurs page because they are tired of requests to like a page . And when a startuper finally succeeds to attract first visitors to his webpage, he sees that users do not stay long there. All a startuper wants to know at that stage is why they navigate away? Startiew.com is a new project by a team of passionate entrepreneurs who know that a quality feedback  or a detailed review is more precious than any amount of likes.  It is also time consuming and expensive to get project reviews from freelance early adopters, who are not motivated to study another web project unless they are paid well.  There are numerous directories and online communities for the startups, but all of them use like/dislike principle: entrepreneurs submit their ideas and get nothing in return.  Startiew.com is built with a different approach: reviews are guaranteed for a web startup free of charge. How is it possible? The users are motivated to write as many reviews as possible., because the rating of a startup at Startiew.com depends on the amount of reviews written by its owner. The higher the rating  the better visibility. The better visibility  the more reviewers from new registered users. Very simple. How it works: 1. Submit startup at www.startiew.com2. Choose another startup from the list and write a detailed review. 3. The owner of this startup owes feedback in return.4. The more reviews written, the higher the rating of a startup is.  Submitting startup at Startiew.com brings apparent and measurable results: first reviews from the community of passionate fellow entrepreneurs, new visitors to a website and first users. On top of it - a valuable feedback from those who know how challenging it is to start something on one's own.  It is worth a try: backlinks will do no one any harm."

Also she served as a corporate trainer for top MNCs like Oracle & Accenture. She is an enduring industrialist, idealistic, and a promising technologist. The 21st century is often remarked as an epochal (era) time in the life of humans. On the one hand they stand mesmerized by the developments in almost every sphere of their life and on the other, perplexed almost in a state of difficulty with all the debacle and debris around them with the onset of a postmodern and a globalized world. At this juncture one realizes the significance of being flexible, tolerant and inclusive in the multi-faceted and pluralistic world marked by malice, strife and dehumanization. While technology makes us more effective and sharper we need to make use of it. In this multicultural and multi-religious world, one needs the courage to take risks, inspire and motivate, and build new strategic partnerships to address global challenges for better todays and tomorrows. Insurance helps us to be on safer sides as the risk of loss is insured and we are in the safer zone.Un-expectancy is a reality of life; we are unaware of what future has in store for us. Even if you're in good health, an unexpected illness or grievance could require you to pay an extra if you don't have insurance.Insurance has turn out to be a noteworthy profitable force in most developed countries. Companies buy insurance to cover their staffs against on-the-job injuries and health problems. Companies also insure their assets, including technology used in production against loss and stealing. Since it makes business processes safer, coverage encourages commerce to make financial dealings, which benefits the economies of countries.Insurance is a means of protection from financial loss. It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.Insurance became more sophisticated and specialized in the modern society.Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for disasters and mitigate the effects of disasters on both households and societies. Methods of insurance1.	Co-insurance  risks shared between insurers2.	Dual insurance  risks having two or more policies with same coverage3.	Self-insurance  situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities4.	Reinsurance  situations when Insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer called Reinsurer. Dream Tekis Software Pvt Ltd was incorporated on 5th 0f Jan 2006, with an almost limitless enthusiasm and is a company driven by passion for Quality, Valuable Customers, Achievement and Entrepreneurship.

Who can afford that?But just as savings can leak out of your organization through dozens  if not hundreds  of cracks, using the right technology can help you not only capture those savings but also uncover additional value at those same points.

Enterprise mobile",Professional Service Automation,"In 1998 the Promys Enterprise PSA software was originally developed for a Cisco Gold/Master for their internal use. When we got to about 15-20 employees we looked at a variety of software solutions. Some were strong at ticketing, or project management, or CRM, but nothing seemed strong across the entire business process. We wanted strong PSA functionality, but we also needed something with equally strong CRM, quoting, procurement, project management, customer asset tracking and inventory handling modules. I never envisioned wed grow to over 150 employees with locations across the country, but I did know I didnt want to go through the software evaluation process again 2-3 years after making our selection.  We couldnt find anything off the shelf we were happy with, so we decided to develop it ourselves, John Breakey Promys founder explained. We spun Promys off as its own corporate entity in 2003. Since then Promys has quickly added customers in IT & managed services, A/V and Physical Security solution providers and systems integrators, including one of the largest and most recognized technology solution providers in the world. The big difference with Promys is, in addition to the traditional PSA help desk and service management functionality, Promys was designed to be strong across the entire business process including forecasting, real-time project costing, equipment handling, and reporting/analytics, which is critical to allow our customers to continue to grow profitably.  John Breakey concludes."

These may produce work content, like tasks, document, bugs or cases. Ideally, these actions are linked to larger processes, like corporate initiatives or projects. The issue is that each of them typically live in disconnected islands of activity, managed by different systems. But what we find is that you really need all three to deliver results. That's what's resulted in Clarizen's vision of bringing together social collaboration and powerful project management, with the goal of turning every company into a real-time, high-performance organization. By tying together those islands of activity, you can build a work graph, much like a social graph, which is organically created through the act of getting work done. Work content can connect to groups or to projects, and they're all surrounded by the conversations, documents and other details that give context to your work. The result? Collaboration that drives results. And thats what drives Clarizen's passion for innovation."

The development of the software was infused by the notion that a project management software needs to be intuitive and practical in its handling. With its two platforms InLoox Web App and InLoox for Outlook, InLoox is now used by more than 45.000 users in more than 50 different countries worldwide.  WHAT WE DO We offer a collaborative project management solution for professionals in every industry that is intuitive, scalable, and works on any device and operating system. InLoox combines the ease of use of a classic desktop software with the advantages of an online project platform.InLoox for Outlook is our flagship product. The intuitive software for task management, project planning and management integrates smoothly in Microsoft Outlook, making all the relevant project management functions accessible directly in the familiar Outlook user interface. Start your project development with the mind mapping function, assign tasks, set milestones, attach relevant documents, allocate resources, keep track of your time schedule and your budget, and analyze your projects directly from Outlook. This greatly improves acceptance with the users, keeps the initial training period to a minimum and reduces the costs for training courses for the company. Any Outlook data, such as your contacts, is directly available for project management and is always synchronized with Microsoft Outlook. If youre looking for a stable, scalable and powerful internet platform for your project management, InLoox Web App is the product of your choice. It is fully-featured, supports any major browser, and is fully web-based making it platform-independent. Again, Outlook integration works smoothly as it can run on the same database. Every team member involved is always up to date, no matter where they are and which device they use. We understand that different users have different needs. Some prefer to use our software solutions installed on their own hardware as a license model and opt for InLoox PM, others rather use the flexible SaaS solution InLoox now! It helps you save costs as we provide server maintenance for you.  WHAT WE STAND FOR Professionals develop for professionals. That means, we take our customers and their needs seriously. You have suggestions for improvement? Great! We are eager to listen and translate your feedback into solutions for you. Because thats what we would expect, too. We treat our customers the way we would like to be treated and we treat each other like family. We are always at your service, no matter the question. For general enquiries, just drop us an email at [emailprotected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ or contact our customer service at [emailprotected]/* <![CDATA[ */!function(t,e,r,n,c,a,p){try{t=document.currentScript||function(){for(t=document.getElementsByTagName('script'),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute('data-cfhash'))return t[e]}();if(t&&(c=t.previousSibling)){p=t.parentNode;if(a=c.getAttribute('data-cfemail')){for(e='',r='0x'+a.substr(0,2)|0,n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)e+='%'+('0'+('0x'+a.substr(n,2)^r).toString(16)).slice(-2);p.replaceChild(document.createTextNode(decodeURIComponent(e)),c)}p.removeChild(t)}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]> */ if you are already a customer. If you want to stay on top of things happening here at InLoox follow us on Twitter, Facebook, or LinkedIn and subscribe to our project management newsletter.

The modules included in Zoho Projects are Tasks and Milestones, Documents, Project Calendars, and Meetings and Forums. All of them are part of the off-the-shelf capabilities of this application. As requirements scale up and needs intensify, the add-on modules of Bug Tracker, Time Tracking and Billing, Wiki, and Chat can be added without problems to the application to provide an economical solution for smaller businesses. Tasks and Milestones: This module provides task management, project milestones, task dependency views, and reporting on any function. Gantt charts and stats of taskswhether new, partially completed, or closedare reported in this module. Document Management: This module allows you to create new documents, presentations, and spreadsheets using Zoho Office Suite and store within the software itself. There is no the need for additional software. The document management functionality allows for many types of files to be uploaded. Microsoft Office, Microsoft Project, OpenOffice, StarOffice, AutoCAD, Photoshop, and ZIP files are all compatible. You can import them into Projects and attach them to current projects. Project Calendars and Meetings: This module organizes meetings, events, and appointments with a browser from your desktop. Project calendars can be shared, you can send automatic reminders, and calendars are accessible from anywhere and for any user of the project. Project Forums: Collaboration is one of the main components of PM. With this module, interactive message boards can be leveraged so that scattered project teams can collaborate, with information accessible to anyone in the team. Time Tracking and Billing (available in higher paid plans)): This module features useful time tracking functionalities and associates timesheets, enabling billing functions. Timesheets are exportable to Zoho Sheets and even to an Excel spreadsheet. When executing a project using Zoho Projects, the Time Sheets functionality capturing project billing requirements can be exported to the Zoho Billing application. Create invoices from the timesheets and send them to various payroll and invoicing systems. Wiki (optional add-on module): This module offers a team intranet collaboration area for adding, sharing, and creating documents, spreadsheets, presentations, and videos, all of which can all be managed in one place. This forms a repository for one source of project tracking. Bug Tracker (optional add-on module): This module allows you to report tracking and fixing bugs as well as the configuration of workflows, and permissions for bug submission and status changes  a nice feature not usually included in PM software. The bug-tracking module is more often used internally as an incident tracker within a project. Chat (optional add-on module): A real-time chat room built for team and project collaboration that is executed from the browser and offers an archiving feature. This module is very useful for white boarding and brainstorming throughout a project life cycle. The chat module can capture several conversations occurring among different work teams."

The internet is increasingly sophisticated and complex, but people are crying out for simplicity. That's where we come in. We make technology beautiful and marketing brilliant. In fact, we've been making things better, easier and more fun for our clients since 1996. Some agencies dream up things without any idea of how to actually make them a reality. We're different. How so, you ask? Our creativity is perfectly paired with a deep understanding of technology. So, when we propose an idea, you know we can make it happen. Founded in 1996 as a software consulting agency, we grew from our tech roots and became web marketing masters in 2002. Since then we've grown into a diverse group of 90ish digital die-hards. We do lots and lots of cool, award-winning work. We know that client collaboration is a key. That's why our clients meet directly with the ones who actually do the work, our subject matter experts. Clients really like working with us because we work smart (geek power!) AND we have fun (have you seen our break room?). But don't just take our word for it. Come experience Gate6 for yourself. "

There's a huge crowd out there consisting of freelancers, startup entrepreneurs, smart employees and forward thinking businesses. Better named: Crowdworkers There are tons of social networks and crowdsourcing marketplaces. But until today there was no Social Crowdsourcing Network. Our network has three key goals: develop tools to Meet, Socialize & Do Business. A powerful profile & newsfeed gives you the ability to Socialize with your local connections and the rest of the world. Crowdsite launched also a ServiceShop for our community. The place where crowdworkers can create a service and sell it worldwide, in our public or their personal shops. A great tool to do Business with new and existing clients. About Crowdsite Crowdsite started as a spin-off of a software development company in 2009 and was founded by Roel Masselink(23). Crowdsite started in the Netherlands with the website ontwerpen-voor-geld.nl; it was an instant hit and quickly it became the largest design website in the Netherlands. A dream was born, quickly Crowdsite realized that the future of the site should be across borders.In 2013 the team decided to create one international brand for our business. The name crowdsite was perfect for the job. So the team rebranded logo-design.de into crowdsite.de and launched the English website crowdsite.com. Today Crowdsite are migrating all Crowdsite domains to one global website with the brand new url https://www.crowd.site"

Managing surveying yourself takes time and often requires a good knowledge of how to create a great survey and how to analyze the collected data. Hiring someone to do it is expensive and usually gives you results long after the customer's opinion was started. Responster solves all of the above by being simple, cheap, smart as well as instant. Products & Services Responster is the simple solution for surveying on many different platforms with the same survey tool. It maximizes your reach while minimizing time spent on creating and collecting. We excel at on-site surveying and surveying in places with poor/no network connections eg. at sea or in the air. Getting a survey up and running takes less than 10 minutes and you can design it to match your brand and style. Target Market Medium-sized to large businesses with an interest in customers and customer service or with a need for employee feedback. Smaller companies with the above needs and companies/organizations who need lead generation are secondary targets.There are future plans to include B2C sales as well, this idea is covered more thoroughly in our pitch. Competitive Advantage -Reach, we want the user to utilize one form to reach all of their intended respondents, regardless of the platform. -Simplicity. We provide the user with a dead simple UI/UX and have excellent support and tutorials. Customers should be able to focus on improving instead of on creation and collection. -Connectivity. Even if you lose connection during collection of data, your data is safe and will be uploaded when connectivity is regained. Management Team As a diverse group of young and innovative people, and with expertise from Investors, we are confident that our creations are a modern take on classic problems."

Slack helps your team work transparently so you can find the people and information you need to make decisions efficiently. Teams in Slack work together in channels that can be organized by project, department, office location, or anything else, really. This makes it easy to follow the topics that are important to you. Public channels are open to anyone on your team so marketing can see what designers are working on, sales can see whats on the product teams roadmap, and new hires can easily get up to speed instead of starting with an empty email inbox.  Slack connects to the tools and services you already use and centralizes your notifications, files, and data from 400+ different applications. This means no more searching through emails for that one follow-up, constantly switching between different tabs and dashboards, or juggling dozens of tools - each with their own login. Slack helps your team work smarter by providing all of the information and context you need to make effective decisions quickly.  Everything you share in Slack is automatically indexed and archived so your company can create a comprehensive knowledge base with zero effort, simply by working in Slack. And, Slacks search makes it easy find the information you need, whenever you need it.  Learn more about Slack at slack.com/is. "

Group Accounts for Corporates",Speech Recognition,"Scribie is audio/video transcription service where we transcribe interview recordings to text, with high quality. Our service is used mostly by journalists, market researchers, videographers, podcasters, authors, etc. The big problem with audio/video transcription is that there no automation. Machines are not very good at conversational speech, yet. Therefore everything has to be done manually. We have built an online system where files are split in smaller parts and the transcripts are crowdsourced. Our dedicated QA team then ensures that the accuracy is as high as possible. We have developed some machine learning based tools which reduce the time and effort required for QA. These tools are our secret sauce and key to our growth. We are faster, better and more efficient than our competitors and are poised to scale fast."
