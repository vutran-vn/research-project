FreshBooks,Write a review,Michael Horth,"Monday, March 25, 2013","Accounting isn't my thing, but FreshBooks makes it easy for me to keep on top of things. Their iPad app is really great for when I'm on the job and want to get paid quick."
FreshBooks,Write a review,Melanie,"Friday, March 22, 2013",Invoicing with FreshBooks saves me so much time. It means I never have to make a call to clients who haven't paid - their automated email system reminds my clients for me!
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kyle Szigeti,"Monday, June 23, 2014","We have been using Intacct for 1.5 years here at Birch Communications. The integration process was not very complicated. We enjoy all of the features that Intacct provides including the custom report writer, drill down capabilities, multi entity reporting, etc. We used Sage Accpac previously and Intacct has been a significant upgrade for our accounting/reporting."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jenni Reiserer,"Tuesday, June 17, 2014","We were using Peachtree previously and had outgrown that product. Intacct gave us the ability to stop relying on spreadsheets to make our revenue recognition entries. This in turn gave us an annual ROI of around $50k because I was on the verge of having to hire someone to keep up with our growing revenue recognition issues. Since 2009 I have not had to add another employee to my department and I attribute that to the use of Intacct and the improvements they have made to their own product. Total estimated savings is over $250,000.There are so many reasons why I like Intacct. The ease of use for our employees is probably one of my favorites. We are a growing software company and every new employee gets a sign in to Intacct so that they can enter their time sheets and expenses. Most employees need minimal training and some have logged in and gotten started without training.Another of my favorites is the dashboards and how easy it is to put a report on one and to make them look professional. We have dashboards for all department heads and even one that is for the typical employee. Now with the latest enhancements getting the most up to date and important info is even easier. The dashboards make me look good to my boss which is a great plus."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Chelsea Parent,"Friday, June 13, 2014","Intacct has been a great company to work with. We are a very tough type of company with very hard financials. Our CEO and CFO have always asked for things that required a lot of manual manipulation, but now that we have Intacct, we are able to create the reports they want and send them out with ease. We are so happy that we've made the switch to Intacct."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kelley,"Thursday, June 12, 2014",INTACCT is great. It's very user friendly and easy to learn. It's pleasant to look at and you can adapt it to your liking by changing colors or menu options.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jennifer Szaro Oehlerts,"Wednesday, June 11, 2014","Intacct had great rev rec schedules.  A significant portion of our revenue is from annual support payments that we recognize over the time period of the annual support.  The Revenue/Accounts Receivable Module makes it easy to record and recognize this revenue automatically rather than having to track it on a spreadsheet and figure out what needs to be recorded monthly.  This is a strong attribute of the software.  Secondarily, being a cloud based solutions has been very helpful when not in the office.Some frustration with the software revolves around the inability to change certain.  For example, once a cash payment has been received, the entry that recorded the invoice cannot be changed.  If you want/need to add a location or department, it can't be done.  Also, the inability to merge accounts and departments to make a more streamlined chart of accounts (especially when you inherited a mess) is frustrating.  There should be more flexibility to make changes.  I know other systems have this flexibility."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Emma Roy,"Tuesday, June 10, 2014","A great cloud based accounting system that has integrated perfectly with our other cloud based programs like Concur expense. The transition to Intacct went very smooth, the program is easy to use, and the reporting is comprehensive. Switching to Intacct allowed us to simplify our GL, going from over 3,000 accounts to under 200. The budgeting features in the program are also really good. Would highly recommend this product.  "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Sadia Jamil,"Monday, June 9, 2014",A best cloud based accounting software for complicated and time consuming revenue recognition process. Data import option is very helpful and time saving.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Cecillia Rivas,"Friday, March 21, 2014",Intacct is a cloud based accounting software that has been easy to learn on the fly. It's great to be able to work away from the office anytime I need to access the software. It is a good choice for any size organization and any industry.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Autumn Kelly,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","A solid accounting program with the capability to run custom reports and analyze projects by time/cost/employee. These capabilities are useful for helping our company keep projects within budget and time scope. I should note, however, that any of our employees have difficulties accessing/using the website with Firefox and Chrome browsers."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jennifer Bomba,"Thursday, March 20, 2014",Intacct is an easy and very effective accounting software to use. I use it everyday with my job and what used to take me hours to do now takes me mere minutes. Thanks Intacct!
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Erika Williams,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","Wonderful accounting program for a small to mid-sized business, especially non-profits. The customization of order entry and integration with Salesforce was critical for our billing department. This functions seamlessly and saves us so much time. I also love that each release seems to add easier functionality to all of our processes."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Erin Horak,"Thursday, March 20, 2014","I have implemented Intacct at two companies now and for a good reason. Although the companies were in different lines of business and different sizes, Intacct was able to meet the needs of each.  It is customizable yet easy to use, even for a ""non-techy"". I would implement Intacct at any company in the future as well."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,William Koellein,"Tuesday, March 18, 2014","Intacct has provided our organization with a robust versatile accounting system that allowed us to go paperless, provided a mobile application from which budget managers can approve transactions and sign checks, and greatly streamlined our processes and procedures saving us time and money."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Joe K,"Tuesday, March 18, 2014","We use Intacct for contract and revenue management as well as billing and A/R.  It has helped us house 1 single warehouse for our over 900  clients with thousands of transactions monthly. It is much more automated than our previous system and much more transparent.  They bring value with each new update. Even if you don't use some of the new features at times, it's nice to know they are constantly improving their product.  Unfortunately, Intacct has not yet figured out a way to allow users to customize their standard reports by adding fields"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Dane smith,"Monday, March 17, 2014","I don't trust anything but intacct.  Once I started using it, my company was hooked. Things run so smooth and clean. "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Jared,"Friday, March 14, 2014",Intacct is a great product that allows you a substantial amount of customization.  My company uses it for a wide range of tasks and provides employees with different dashboards dependent on their job title or practice.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kenny Mitchell,"Friday, March 14, 2014","Intacct is a great solution for any small to mid- market Company. Whether managing a services or technology Company (hardware and/or software)... it has so many intuitive components that you typically don't even see in large enterprise solutions (e.g. Oracle/SAP/etc...) due to the simple integrations to tons of third- party applications. For the $100M enterprise business on Oracle or SAP... Intacct could actually be an alternative to save significant $$$ and get added value out of the finance, accounting, revenue, and reporting teams. This application is not perfect... there are none perfect... no not one. However... I am a finance person by trade, but can configure custom reports, fields, integration field mappings, approvals, workflows, etc... not something I would dare to touch in the clunky world of legacy ""ERPs.""This is not Quickbooks my friends... this is not Dynamics.... or a Netsuite. Intacct appears to be focused on being a cloud- based... well- rounded and intuitive business system built on new technology with lots of features and regular updates that are driven to the new- age of finance operations. If you want to be a bookeeper... don't buy it... because you won't get the value. If you want to be a business partner... go for it!"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Ronald,"Wednesday, March 12, 2014",I have been using this software for a year and it has been great. I'm able to run reports with great options.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Matt Daniels,"Tuesday, March 11, 2014","Intacct is a middle-of-the-road accounting solution. It gets the basics done as any other solution would, but it's not incredibly robust, and some of the navigation is clunky. It can be integrated with Salesforce, which is a plus though. Customized reporting lacks intuitiveness and user-friendliness, but can be learned. Plain and simple, the Intacct solution just works. I can't think of a time I've ever encountered a bug."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Mark H,"Tuesday, March 11, 2014",This is a great system with customer field ability and reporting and great customer support.

My billing and reporting duties can be completed with ease, and I am always learning a new functionality of the system that allows me to perform tasks quicker and more efficiently. Intacct is easy to learn, easy to use, and its possibilities seem endless!"
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Teri Opena,"Thursday, March 6, 2014",Intacct is a great tool for our company. We have so many different departments where we are able to use the dashboards to upload our excel files for our whole company to use. It's perfect for our accounting department as it helps keep track of what bills we have paid and what we have not. We are still new to using this product and learning about all of it's capabilities but so far it has helped our company grow in what we can offer to our clients.
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Kenny C.,"Thursday, March 6, 2014","Intacct is accounting of the future. It streamlines tasks allowing for greater financial clarity. The system itself is user-friendly and designed to provide the best user experience. Reports are designed to be flexible so information is at your disposal in various forms. Overall, a great system with high recommendation. "

Intacct Corporation,Write a review,stephanie denton,"Monday, December 16, 2013","The program is useful for working in the AR department, we are able to view past recent payments, all of our customers accounts and easily switch from tab to tab to review customers accounts. "
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,Dave Skahan,"Monday, December 16, 2013","I've only been using Intacct for a few months and I found it very easy to pick up and I'm learning more and more complex things in the system each day. Whether I'm using existing reports or creating my own, Intacct is user-friendly and when you can't figure something out, the help function and training/seminars that they offer are quite useful. I also find their offerings to their customers to be frequent and useful and it really is a system that makes a difference in Financial Reporting."
Intacct Corporation,Write a review,September Stanley,"Thursday, December 12, 2013",I am a staff accountant with a value added reseller in North Carolina. We recently made the transition from QuickBooks to Intacct and have watched our efficiencies improve drastically! The custom reporting allows you to design and create a plethora of reports so that any information you need is readily available. I would highly recommend Intacct to any company who has outgrown their current ERP software.

The changeover from my other accounting software was  simple enough for me to figure out on my owner, and the import process was accurate and easy. The importing of online statements makes the process so easy and removes the human error of manual data entry. Safe to say, I Love this product!"
Xero,www.xero.com,Cazza,"Wednesday, September 25, 2013","Just got the Xero for dummies book. Love it, it has reassured me what I am doing is correct and after reading only a couple of chapters I can navigate my way round the dashboard etc much quicker. Thank you for another great help tool."

Xero,www.xero.com,Chris,"Tuesday, August 20, 2013","Streamlines the payment process. Tells me when a customer has seen a sent invoice form.  Payment is efficient and makes the online payment process easy both for the business and the consumer. I didn't like not being able to add attachments to the invoices, but other than that it has served my basic needs well. "
Xero,www.xero.com,Ben Foster,"Monday, August 19, 2013"," I was searching for a way to keep all of my books and accounting details up to date and after careful research, I decided Xero was the way to go.  I am glad I chose Xero because I was able to finally do my own taxes and accounting without having to hire a CPA.  As a result, I was able to cut expenses and ended up with a large tax return.  I am now a customer for life."
Xero,www.xero.com,Lee Greenwood,"Friday, August 9, 2013",Easy to use and covers all my bases. Xero lets me track everything I need to keep track of in my business without being needlessly complex. Definitely give this one a free try!

The best thing to do is find software that fits your needs and that is was Xero does. The software makes it quick and extremely easy to manage your account and do various billings. Xero can also be used anywhere as long as you have your computer, it is definitely the best software out there today for businesses with simple to complex accounting needs."
Xero,www.xero.com,Lucy Enoka,"Tuesday, February 26, 2013","Xero is simply amazing! Everything about it is genius. It is so easy to use. You wont feel like you are doing your accounting. I can honestly say the best thing  about it from switching to Xero a year ago, is the time it has given me back with my 2 small children. I will work anywhere from 6-12 hrs a week on my accounts and the 12 hour week is the billing week. That's all! Our business is classed medium size as well. I can use it anywhere. Go on holiday and still know where im at, pay bills etc. I would be very nervous about changing from them now. There is no better program for us! Change now! Thank you Xero!  "

Xero,www.xero.com,Kassie,"Friday, December 28, 2012","My small business was struggling, we couldn't keep track of our expenses and our invoice system was a joke.

Xero,www.xero.com,Tal Ziv,"Thursday, December 27, 2012","We tried so many other online accounting systems for our small business and none of them fitted the bill.

The support team is great and very responsive."
Xero,www.xero.com,Anne,"Thursday, December 27, 2012",A very comprehensive service that helps with all aspects of business usage. Great to have all the accounting and evaluation pieces in one place with Xero.

Xero,www.xero.com,Mark Forbes,"Friday, December 14, 2012","I discovered Xero after having a bad experience with another company. Not only is it highly intuitive to use, but the updates to the software happen every few months. If the feature you want is not there now, you can have confidence that it will be there soon. I estimate that I spend 30-50% less time processing transactions, which means more time is available for generating useful management information for my clients. The result is all my clients are now on Xero (and WorkflowMax). Its a no-brainer!"
Xero,www.xero.com,Paul Scott,"Wednesday, December 12, 2012","Xero has proved to be an excellent solution to our accounting needs. Following the SaaS model and being accessible from anywhere makes it really easy for us to share our accounts with our accountants. It also removes the reams of paper we used to have to pass around. It is a fully functional platform providing a great suite of tools for managing your financial business on. We especially like the invoicing integration and the bank feeds. It is almost worth signing up for Xero and then choosing your bank as not all banks are equal. One note is their pricing model, depending on how your business is structured you can find that there is only one small aspect of Xero that is relevant. This would mean you need to move higher up their model. Whether it be the number of invoices or multi-currency support you can find your costs increasing due to a need for one small aspect. However, the functionality and support outweigh this quickly."
Xero,www.xero.com,William S.,"Monday, December 10, 2012",This software has saved me and my business time and money.  It is so simple to understand and use. I can access it on the go from my mobile phone or while I am home. Definitely for the small business owner who is concerned with their bottom line.
Xero,www.xero.com,Marie,"Thursday, November 29, 2012",This software is simple and easy to use. Even beginners can get up to speed on quickly and it really makes your accounting work more productive.  I would especially recommend it for small business owners and entrepreneurs who have more important things to do than waste their day trying to figure out complicated accounting software.
Xero,www.xero.com,Randy,"Wednesday, November 28, 2012",This software has done wonders. I can now manage all the info I need for my business super easy and super fast. I would recommend this for anyone who has to multitask throughout the day.  
Xero,www.xero.com,Robert Ryan,"Monday, November 26, 2012",This product is great. I operate a small video production company that primarily does weddings and event videography. This program is extremely easy to use and even my wife enjoys using it when usually finances stress her out!
Xero,www.xero.com,Anja O'Connor,"Friday, June 8, 2012","Best of breed software at it's best. Another star for creating an environment for integration.

Xero,www.xero.com,Jacqui Jones,"Monday, June 4, 2012","As you can tell with 5 stars all round I am a real fan of Xero. Since early 2008 it has completely changed the relationship I have with 'that side' of my business.As a Mac and PC user who is often out of the office (developing and delivering a business renovation challenge that boosts established Kiwi businesses NZ-wide), and being very committed to providing a good experience for my clients (right through to correct and timely invoicing),  Xero has made a big difference. I am now happy to spend time on 'that side' because the time required is so much shorter - the system is very visual, uncluttered and smart. Xero almost makes 'doing the books' fun and it certainly contributes to peace of mind."
Xero,www.xero.com,Ryan Baker,"Monday, June 4, 2012","We have used Xero since 2007 - for two companies and an investment trust. It is one of the best, if not the best, SaaS app that we have used in our businesses. If you're not using Xero for your accounting software, give it a try. It is addictively awesome."

Connec,www.connec.me,Josh Lee,"Monday, November 18, 2013","My boss asked me to handle her accounting and I wanted something that I could learn easily, handle everything I needed, and be able to access it anywhere.  Definitely great for small businesses!"
Connec,www.connec.me,Yu-De Chen,"Friday, November 15, 2013",My company has used Servora from the very beginning. It's come to the point that we wouldn't know what to do anymore without them. They may lack some features but their customer service and attentiveness is why we love them.
Connec,www.connec.me,Alice Benson,"Monday, November 4, 2013","Servora fulfills all the primary needs for the accounting side of my business. What I love the most about Servora is that they have GREAT customer service! Responsive, professional, and personable! "
Connec,www.connec.me,rod beets,"Monday, October 28, 2013","Great accounting software!!  Makes running day to day business much easier for me.  It can do it all payroll, billing and expenses.  Much cheaper then hiring one of those payroll places.  I will tell anyone opening a company to get this software suite.  It will give you the time to run the business you love and not the paper work you hate."
Connec,www.connec.me,Leo,"Friday, August 2, 2013","I run a small business, and the thing I really like about Servora is that it brings Accounting and CRM features together in ONE system, which helps me focus on growing my company.

I would recommend it to everyone!
Connec,www.connec.me,Charles Chen,"Friday, July 26, 2013",Servora has been awesome to work with. Everything is managed all in one place. There is no integration between software anymore! So happy I went with them instead of getting charged for every integration I had to do with different software.
Connec,www.connec.me,Peter,"Friday, July 26, 2013","Our team has been very happy with the switch to Servora and one thing interesting is the collaboration feature which I haven't seen it in other accounting software. At first we were skeptical and thought it was a gimmick, but it was actually the best invention that could happen to accounting software, I can't believe why anyone hasn't thought of that before! Overall highly recommended and if you have more than one person in your company, this is probably the only choice for you."
Connec,www.connec.me,Melody Huang,"Tuesday, July 23, 2013",Our company has been using Servora for over a year now and I love how we decided to make the switch from Excel and QuickBooks.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Laurie Kaplin,"Thursday, May 15, 2014","My company has been using AvidXchange's AvidInvoice product since 2006.  We use Yardi for our accounting and property management software.  When we started using AvidInvoice we scanned and coded all our own invoices, but we are now using their AvidBill Network -  where Avid scans and (default) codes the invoices before they reach our coders and approvers.Our Avid implementation was extremely easy.  The implementer was here for about a week and we were up and running by the time he left.  The hardest part of the implementation was thinking through the approver roles that we needed and we created this information in a spreadsheet for each property BEFORE our implementer came onsite.  To this day we still use that spreadsheet as our key for the workflows that our invoices follow.  The management process is so much better with Avid and invoices are not lost or left sitting on someone's desk.Our property managers and accountants love that they can look up an invoice for a vendor, see the invoice image, and tell if it's been paid all by themselves.  Management appreciates knowing exactly where our invoices are at any given moment.As my company's software administrator for AvidXchange I can't say there haven't been bumps in the road over the past 8 years, however; AvidXchange is the most responsive and concerned software vendor I've dealt with in my 28 years in the IT industry.  I absolutely recommend AvidXchange software for handling your invoice processing.  They have been a first class company since day one and I would be happy to talk with anyone about my experience with AvidXchange.-Laurie Kaplin, Sr. Programmer/Analyst (& AvidXchange Administrator)NTS Development Company"
AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Erica,"Wednesday, May 14, 2014","We have been live with Avid for a little over 2 years.  We love it! Having worked with other AP automation software companies, I can attest to the fact that Avid is doing it right.  The customer service is unmatched in the industry.  With any automation, there comes a little leg work getting to the point of going live, but Avid is wonderful in terms of communicating that early and often.   The sales process and implementation process ran as smoothly as I could imagine. It's important to call out that you'll get from Avid whatever you/your team puts into it.  Plan thoughtfully, and the Avid team will walk you through the implementation, step by step. Once you go live, you'll see real results.  We were able to re-dedicate an entire AP person to another role, from which we're benefiting immensely. From beginning to end, the Avid team has been more than available, responsive, and helpful. Thank you, Avid, for helping us use our resources in more efficient ways! "
AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Gary Hess,"Thursday, May 8, 2014","We have been a client of AvidXchange for more than 10 years and are extremely pleased with ther AvidInvoice electronic invoice processing application.

Not only has it eliminated paper but also saved us a large amount of money in overnight fees, paper costs and soft costs involved in employees no longer taking time to find out ""where is my invoice?"".   During the past 10 years they have continued to enhance the product in order to make it more user friendly.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,John,"Wednesday, February 5, 2014","The software did not work as I had anticipated.

AvidXchange,www.avidxchange.com,Mark Stevens,"Friday, May 10, 2013","What did I just buy? After a long and gruelling sales process with a misleading sales rep, we finally made the jump with avid. To begin, we were promised a 30 day implementation time frame, 60 days later the software was finally set up appropriately. Thankfully the billing didn't begin until after we were live, however, right after, everything turned to complete hell. With major bugs and lots of support tickets things finally started to subside and we were able to fully use the software, three months later. This is when we really found out the lies that were sold to us. With this software we were under the expectation that avid would handle all of our scanning of invoices, even while negotiating the contract we were promised this. False! They will only handle a small percentage. We were also under the impression that avid would automatically push date between our accounting software, mri.  False! You will have to run a report manually, manually export the files, manually important the files into mri, where's the automatic integration? Workflows was a huge deciding factor, previous to avid, we've been burned by invoices being approved by the incorrect individuals. Once again with avid, we were under the assumption, invoices would have to take a predetermined workflow through the entire system. False, the individual coding the invoice must choose the workflow. At the end of the day, Im unsure of what avid actually does for me? I'm still scanning hundreds of invoices, Im still manually putting data into mri, and Im still manually routing invoices for approval. Be wary friends! Make sure you ask questions, and if you don't get a straight forward answer, ask again! Good luck."

Jeff could not resolve the problems and left the site not working and with the fatal error still active so the site could not be seen. obvious he is no good at what he is doing..  I have requested a refund because of there many other issues and lack of quality at this host.. I would not recommend this host save yourself the stress of a low grade host and move on..

Hostoople,www.hostoople.com,Marco Sterling,"Monday, September 29, 2014","Think that it will be useful to share my experience dealing with Hostoople.com. I have also spent so much time looking for good, reliable web hosting provider with advance technology for future. Most of the other provider's email box/account has some kind of limitation so please beware of those top rated provider with basic setup. You will also file some coupon around for additional discount. Their tech support knows what they are doing and can solve issues fast. Any questions I've had have been answered quickly.They also offer 30 minutes a month worth of updates for free. The basic Hostoople plan is $3.95/month, and on some other sites you can get a lot more space and bandwidth. But, of course, some of the other sites that oversell hosting also have terrible service and reliability. So far everything is good...if it changes I will post again but for now I and my friends in the USA are happy."

BannerFlow,www.bannerflow.com,Jack van Metre,"Thursday, November 20, 2014","I wouldn't bother with this product.

Google Analytics,www.google.com/analytics/,James Ketchell,"Saturday, March 16, 2013","We started using google analytics back when it was under its original name of Urchin.  A lot has changed since then, not least with this software. The Good: Its free!  Not many places you can get access to essentially enterprise level software for a zero cost. Infinitely customizable.  There are numerous websites and manuals available which can teach you ways of turning GA into an almost bespoke solution for your business. Google continues to innovate this product on what seems like a weekly basis.  In recent months the push has been heavily towards social media analytics.   The Bad: Steep learning curve for the uninitiated. Bias towards google adwords when it regards advertising tracking. Currently offers relatieve weak mobile analytics.

TeamDesk,Write a review,Michael Ver Duin,"Wednesday, March 9, 2016","The online, cloud based solution that we've created with TeamDesk's database keeps my business running. We use it to track jobs in shop, and reference them in reorders. We aren't even using the system to the fullest extent, but it is nice to know that when we have an idea, the software is there to build what we need.The few times we couldn't, the staff at TeamDesk was responsive and quick with work-arounds or implementations of new code. It isn't exactly 'Programming', but it is. You've got to plan out what you want, and then build it. If you can flow chart your process and are decent with putting together formulas, then this is the software for you.  We started in MS Access, and eventually went online with DabbleDB as we built more and more features into our workflow. When DabbleDB got bought, we looked long and hard for another solution. We didn't 'settle' on TeamDesk, we were excited to move up to their services, functionality, and flexibility. "
PerfectForms,Write a review,Robert Cohen,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","As department Graduate Programs Coordinator with four MS/PhD programs, I use Perfectforms for all graduate admissions (approximately 300 applications a year).  We are completely satisfied.  The program is very flexible, can handle all our needs, and seamlessly collects applications and letters of recommendation for us, including a) notifying us (and the applicant) about materials, and b) requesting letters, all of which we are notified about via email.  I can easily access information prior to our application deadlines, and after deadlines have passed, I can download all the information to Excel so that I can manipulate it in various ways for the faculty. Whenever questions have arisen, especially during the early development of our application, I found the Perfectforms personnel to be extremely helpful and competent.  This product has met or surpassed all our needs and expectations."
PerfectForms,Write a review,Mihir Desai,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","We are avid users of PerfectForms for over 5 years now and the nifty forms service over the cloud continues to meet more and more of our internal business and external client needs.

We have leveraged the workflow capabilities in auditing, reporting and publishing of collected data.  In general the tool could be configured as a fully functional development suite with rich UI and enterprise grade database back end that can fulfill almost any business process re-engineering projects.  Hosted over the cloud allows us to meet high availability SLA's with our end customers.  More so than the service itself - the support is fantastic.  Most of our questions are answered within a business day and a friendly account representative is at hand to arrange for any user training as well as bring in technical folks to the table to collaborate with us on our application designs.

Perfect Forms helped our School District solve our application processing issues.

Perfect Forms not only has allowed us to streamline this application process, but it has dramatically reduced overall time spent to process our Option 2s. Due to Perfect Forms industry leading feature set, we are now looking to move some of our business processing to Perfect Forms.

PerfectForms,Write a review,Mike Abney,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","I've been using PerfectForms since 2007. As the Effectiveness and Efficiency Facilitator, one of my duties is to seek out products and services that will make our processes more effective and efficient.I was introduced to PerfectForms after being tasked with improving the process of enrolling Dual Enrollment Students. These students are still in High School and receive College credit as well as High School credit for a given course.One of the greatest challenges of this use case was its workflow. Parents, Students, High School Counselors, the Dual Enrollment Office, Admissions, the Business Office, and Records all had to be involved in enrolling these students every Fall Semester.With PerfectForms, we took what was a manually routed, paper based process that left parents wondering if they had submitted everything needed, to a fully automated process that is routed via email, incorporated text messaging and email notifications to keep everyone on the same page, and even provided the Counsellors a way to send a High School transcript attached to a PerfectForms paperless but paper-like form. This form included everything that was on a multi-part carbonless form, and even included electronic signatures.Since then we here at UT Martin and even throughout the State of Tennessee University System, have used PerfectForms to empower users to improve their own processes and even create complete solutions by using over 900 forms.PerfectForms to us is a beloved tool that allows the repurposing of time to be spent doing more subjective things, and leaving ""the  paperwork"" in the hands of a perfect process, built by ""the boots on the ground"" using ""perfect forms""."
PerfectForms,Write a review,Heather Baldic,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","The need for PerfectForms came about in 2009. Our company received and processed hundreds of multi-page/multi-copied customer profiles. We were looking for a legally binding digital way for customers to sign off on their profile sheet. PerfectForms was the only company that provided this multi-layered digital approval process that our law team would accept as binding.  We have since created many internal business forms to reduce errors, track budgets, and decrease our environmental footprint. The forms are easy to build with 100% customization.  Our interaction with the sales and support team has also been exceptional. Both our support agent and our account manager are responsive and knowledgeable. I would recommend PerfectForms to ANY business looking to increase productivity, employee accountability, and reduce human errors. "

PerfectForms,Write a review,Dawn Crawford,"Monday, August 11, 2014","Perfect Forms for us started with a need to follow workflow for 2 specific forms; that was two years ago.  Since those 2 initial forms our usage has grown and continues to - I believe we are at 65  forms now.  We have been able to eliminate a great deal of paper, and have complete tracking along the way.  If user 1 submits a form, we can see that it was approved by the next layer, and currently stuck at the final approval.  No more misplaced paper versions.The online form designer is both easy and intuitive.  Creating a new simple form or adjusting workflow can be done in a matter of minutes.  Additional functionality can be easily added along with creating dynamic reports.Customer service at Perfect Forms is truly phenomenal. Both email and phone calls are answered quickly. All in all its a great service!  I cannot say enough good things about Perfect Forms, it has given us the ability to roll out, update, ensure consistency, and track all at once."
PerfectForms,Write a review,T Spencer,"Monday, August 11, 2014",We use Perfect Forms to conduct an annual survey of our member schools regarding standardized test scores. The survey is easy for our schools to complete and the form is easy to update each year. This is a very powerful tool.

Snappii,www.snappii.com,Leo S,"Monday, May 23, 2016","Started working with Snappii for a simple App for our business in November 2015, told that it would take 3-4 weeks to complete. Buyer beware! Please do not use this company if you value your time and money!6 months later, no App, lost my money.Endless back and forth to explain simple concepts that seemed to go without comprehension. Passed through too many employees, several of which do not work for the company any more. Given numerous excuses for why they were not getting back to us (""too much snow"", ""dental problems"") To make a long story short, against our better judgement gave them a second and third chance, and still have no working product and are out our money. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us if you need more convincing to stay away from Snappii!"

I contacted them, and together we developed the app. It became the Profit Pal Mobile Invoicing App. There team of developers were very professional.Cu do's to them for doing an excellent job. My app is now on Apple iTunes and Google Play.Thanks to the Snappii team.  "
GoodBarber,www.goodbarber.com,Nikki Mezic,"Monday, July 18, 2016","Bad platform, extremely difficult for beginners. Help is non-existant,  if you can't find answers in their blog or online help section you're screwed. You can reach out to their live help but they will give you the most basic & slow response (I think they are based in Europe) and direct you to the online help section and blog you've already exhausted looking for answers that aren't there. I inherited an app that was designed in 2014 using html code. They have a new interface where you don't need to know code, unfortunately my old app can't be modified using the new interface so I have to update the code and I do not know html code. Also, you can't delete and app and replace it you have to pay for a new one. Bottom line, GoodBarber is a horrible app builder, hard to use and no help system in place. Best idea would be to pay someone to create your app for you and save yourself the frustrationg and time suck of trying to use this platform."

I wish all the best to the team of Mobiloitte and also recommend them to others."

Zoho,Write a review,Neil Leigh,"Friday, February 6, 2015","I have been using Zoho CRM on and off for several years. I have used it both as a free and paid service (my needs have changed during that time and Zoho lets you up and downgrade as you need). In my opinion, Zoho CRM gives a lot of bang for the buck and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who needs to follow up with customers on a regular basis. Zoho CRM lets you document all relevant information about customers and potential customers, helps you to keep leads in the forefront of your activity, gives plenty of reporting options and additionally has a ton of flexible setup options like adapting the screens to show only the fields you need, changing field names and exporting  data. I have used the export option extensively to get the required mailing info for an external emailer application and it has worked very well.Deserves 5 stars."
Zoho,Write a review,Wayne,"Monday, July 7, 2014","I Have been using the free email and web hosting service.  Until now, I had been perfectly happy with the service.  Unfortunately, you get what you pay for - I pay noting and in terms of support to resolve a problem - I have so far got nothing.  Slow responses, useless suggestions and no solution after nearly 2 weeks with the problem.  Don't be a scrooge - pay for a better service.  Can't recommend at all."

CATS,www.catsone.com,LeQuay Marsh,"Friday, June 27, 2014","Let me start by saying that I have been with CATS for the past few years. My experience has been nothing short of excellent. CATS has far more robust features than the other recruitment systems I've explored and/or used. It can be used to manage candidate flow for existing requisitions or to build strategic candidate pipelines for the needs of the future. CATS is easy to customize the system internally to work within your existing recruitment processes. Most of the other tools I've used has required us to create multiple work around processes forcing and even change our internal processes to meet the requirements of the system. This isn't the case with CATS and it only took us an hour or two to set it up.CATS has made various plug-ins available free of charge to its subscribers. These plug-ins allow you to do everything from edit resumes within the system using a Microsoft Word Plug-in, leverage WordPress, and even send LinkedIn profiles and resumes from job boards directly into the CATS system.You can easily move data from other recruiting systems to CATS. You can either upload large batches of resumes or even upload a CSV document  from Excel directly into the system.One of the best features behind CATS is that it is a tool that continues to grow and is always improving. They continue to grow in excellence through the value they place on the feedback from their subscribers. Many of the suggestions recommended by subscribers have been implemented very successfully and relatively quickly.I strongly recommend any organization looking for an extremely robust and customizable recruitment solution to consider CATS. You can even avoid lengthy contracts."
CATS,www.catsone.com,Michael Aubrecht,"Wednesday, June 11, 2014","I've been in the recruiting business for 25 years.  I tried just about every type of recruiting software on the market.

I'm not the most technical person and they make everything easy to understand and use.  They are open to suggestions regarding added features and they're always striving to make their product the best out there.  If you try it, you'll stay forever!"

Ease of scalability with the plans of Ace fits best for my needs. The thing that I liked most about them is their support. I simply call them and they do all the changes with plans as per my demands. They do not force the sale or try to misguide me. Often the solution was delivered over live chat. Great job Acecloud."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Lori L,"Monday, April 18, 2016",I was having issues with my QB file and a representative called me right away and was able to resolve the issue on a timely basis.  I am very satisfied with the quality of their service and the quick response.
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Sharon L.,"Wednesday, April 13, 2016","Ace Cloud Hosting is good with hosting and support. I am using their hosting services for different software for accounting including Drake, ATX, QuickBooks, etc. Their plans are cost effective and even the quality of service is fine. Though they offer hosting service for all types of application, their expertise is limited to accounting. That might be their only limitation."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Susan Q. Wilson,"Monday, March 14, 2016","I have been using QB for quite some time now. And  I have gathered through my experiences that one should choose the hosting party very sincerely. Because they are the ones who remain stuck with you later.  Ace Cloud Hosting has done well enough, as much as I can say as a user.  I had switched to them after using another hosting provider.  And it been almost two years now. Except few instances when the server was down.  Their customer support is just great. "
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Bob Ross,"Monday, February 29, 2016","Customer support is the factor for which I will always stay with Ace Cloud Hosting. I have used a couple of different service providers before Ace Cloud Hosting and being technically feeble, I could not get comfortable with the cloud. So, I had to opt for a provider that can offer the convenience with the support. Ace Cloud Hosting is certainly the best of them all. I never found myself waiting for the call to be answered, the support staff is polite and most importantly, resolves my issues effectively. They have been impressing ever since my trial period. Now more than 2 years with them, my issues are lesser in number but their support abilities still keep getting better."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Denise,"Monday, February 8, 2016","I am using the hosting services of Ace Cloud Hosting for QB Pro, Lacerate 2012-15, and MS Office Standard for a fluctuating number of users. Right from pricing to support, Ace has been thoroughly satisfying for all the applications. Its not just me, but all the users working with me find ACHs work appreciable."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Cheval Lewis,"Tuesday, October 27, 2015","These guys are amazing with their services. Downtime was my concern while choosing cloud services, but Ace Cloud Hosting has justified that my decision of choosing them. It has been some years since I am hosting my QuickBooks on their servers and I am yet to face any downtime issue. I have even switched the plans for a greater number of users during the tax seasons. Their effectiveness in delivering that was pretty impressive as well. There have been occasions when I had some issues with the printing, but support staff was able to help me with that. I believe thats acceptable with the technical stuff. The best part is that I never had to wait for the tech support- even during the rush hours. What more can I ask for?"
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Arthur,"Friday, September 25, 2015",I have been using QuickBooks Desktop for 5 years and cant imagine my company running without it. Was a user at other company and their service was satisfactory for the first year. However in the next year it was horrible. The servers were always going down and the support staff was really unhelpful. They just put me on hold saying their technicians are looking into the problem. A colleague told me to switch to Ace Cloud which I did. The setting up and migration of my data was smooth and quick. Even after that they have been really helpful and all the problems that come up are solved instantaneously. The servers run well with hardly any downtime. Excellent service and excellent support. Now that its been 6 months with them I only hope that they maintain their quality of service in future also.
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Anita J Deslauriers,"Monday, September 7, 2015","Hi, I chose AceCloudHosting for QuickBooks hosting almost a year ago and I have to admit that Im really impressed with their services. The setup was pretty fast, which was initiated right after the payment. There have been uptime issues at times. They promised a 99.9% and I think they are just able to maintain that. Support service is more than satisfactory and support guys have always been polite and friendly. Recently I hired a couple of new staff members and they werent all that comfortable with hosted QuickBooks. I will commend Ace Clouds support guys for guiding them pretty well and being patient with them. As a customer, Im more than satisfied with their service. I hope they continue this service quality in future also."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,"Eva Scott, Accountant","Friday, August 14, 2015","The thing that I like most about guys at Ace is they keep things simple and straight. The support person who assisted me was concerned about my requirements. Though he gave me some suggestions with the plan, but he did not force me for upsell.Right from that moment, Ace Cloud has kept adding more to the positive impression. I have hardly faced any issue related with installation, setup, and rest of technical operations. Maybe some minutes of downtime in a year.Its been close to a year since I have been using their services and the only reason for which I had to contact them after the installation was for increasing the users. They did good job even then. It is sometimes surprising that they are continuously able to maintain pretty quick response time."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Melinda Jonson,"Thursday, July 2, 2015","Its been more than 2 years since AceCloudHosting has been hosting QuickBooks for me and I believe that is good enough time to judge a service.Mostly, they have been a little lower with up time than what they promise. But their support guys have supported during the days when I was not well-versed with using QuickBooks, so I dont mind the issue with up time. I have even faced issues with some add-ons sometimes, which can be very frustrating and annoying. Again their technical support has been able to rescue. They are able to fix the things up pretty quickly, which is impressive. So, their service is a mix of some good and some bad.I would not say that they are offering some exceptional services, but they are not bad enough think of other option. Technically, their service may offer some rough patches, which I believe is unavoidable with such services. But their approach always sounds customer-friendly, literally. So, I am going to stay with them for some good time."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Danielle Neidig,"Thursday, May 14, 2015","Almost a week ago, I was not able to access to any service offered by Ace Cloud Hosting. On contacting the customer support, I was informed that services are under some upgrading and it was expected to take another hour for services to reinstate. I was furious to hear this as I had to work on some files urgently. Though I was very rude, the customer support behaved pleasantly. They also suggested me to work offline on the files available in backup till the online services get back in action.Thankfully, the backup they provided was recent and I was able to get the job done well in time. I understand that upgrading actions are unavoidable for such services and Ace Cloud Hosting did the job considerably well. Only lacking I feel is that you guys should have informed me earlier that services will be down during those duration."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Ralph J Wilson CPA,"Friday, April 10, 2015","They are flawless and perfect with their sales ability. I was convinced that Ace Cloud Hosting is the best possible option for me but things did not last that way for long. Setup was initiated and completed in moment after payment. But soon I faced connectivity issues with their service and support team had to get the things repaired. Their up-time issue is usually fine but sometimes turns slow. While working on some urgent needs, this issue seems unbearable.Their overall services are fine enough. I might be criticizing them more because of the high expectations they had set during the sale, but they have not been able lived up to them."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Sean Barhorst,"Thursday, April 2, 2015","I switched to Ace Cloud Hosting, because my previous hosting solution was not providing quality support services. It has been more than 3 months with Ace Cloud Hosting and I am now comfortable using it. However, initial phase with them was not very pleasant and I faced some issues during installation and setup. Sometimes, even minute changes in configuration were causing issues.To be honest, that could well be because I was well adapted to the previous service that I was using. Thankfully, technical support of Ace Cloud Hosting did a more than fine job in assisted well. I appreciate their efficiency. But more than that it was their friendliness because of which I did not switched back to my previous service. Of late, I am able to use this service finely and for most reasons I would recommend using this service."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,"Melinda Smith, CPA","Sunday, March 1, 2015","I have been using Ace services for about a year now.  Their constant effort to satisfy clients is commendable.  They provide you with tailor-made plans that suit your needs.I got in touch with AceCloudHosting last summer and was pleased with the pricing they offered me. I took my time and opted for the starter plan, just to scrutinize the services. I was satisfied with their responsiveness and tech support and took the 1-year subscription. They always keep me updated with all the latest updates of the servers and other heavy applications that I use.However, there are some minor issues that keep coming up. Server updates that are usually done on Sundays, slows down the business process a bit. If they can also change the schedule of updating windows, that would be really helpful. Printing documents becomes a hectic task sometimes, unless Uniprint software is not installed on the server.Above all the working pattern of Ace Cloud Hosting is satisfactory."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Andrei Macsin,"Wednesday, February 18, 2015","Am taking QuickBooks hosting services from Ace from almost 1 year now. There were some server downtime issues initially. Unresolved issues for many days were also a matter of concern for my company. I tried to get in touch with the technical staff and was assured of better performance but nothing much changed.However, now they seem to have improved in those terms. Last week they delivered our 3 servers within 45 minutes.I would still suggest this company for hosting purpose because they still have something better than the others. Their customer service has improved a lot and is professional in handling queries. The security of your private data is dealt with excellence. Login issues are very minimal and the remote access of applications works fine. There is nothing much that is alarming. "
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Lena Woodruff,"Friday, January 30, 2015","I have a small firm and I have been using QuickBooks since 2012. I went into a lot of research for deciding as to who would be the best hosting provider for QuickBooks. Some were bad and some were good but in the end I rooted for AceCloudHosting. The main reason being that their pricing structure is fairly competitive and the way they treat their customer is very satisfying. Great tech support as well, all my issues and queries were promptly resolved. There were some issues related to service interruption few days back..hope it wouldnt happen again."
Ace Cloud Hosting,www.acecloudhosting.com,Kevin Anderson,"Friday, January 16, 2015","I signed up for QuickBooks hosting last year with AceCloudHosting. Setup was performed instantly, right after the payment. I had no issue with their price and support; these guys are very good and responsive. But their servers or data centers are somewhat slow; they are not providing server uptime of 99.9%, as promised. So, based on their service I have received overall positive experience and hope they would keep their promise of server uptime."

The system has worked perfectly and if we ever do have a problem they fix it within minutes - these guys never sleep! QuickBooks runs very quickly (faster than on most local pcs) and it is good to know that there is always a current back up. Highly recommended even if  overseas  - and finally at a great price too.

I started to get a bit of accounting help, and so we put the files on Cloudwalk Hosting so that two of us could access Quickbooks.  We don't have  a company network (yet).  Initially, it gave us the safety of daily backups which I was previously doing infrequently.This has been very convenient for us.  Also, I have always found Cloudwalks Hosting to be very responsive whenever issues or problems arise.  I recommend them to anyone looking for additional security knowing your data is backed up daily and for ease in accessing from multiple computers and multiple sites"

Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Edward Culp,"Thursday, November 5, 2015",Elucentra has been a reliable and responsive server for my Quickbooks.  They give extremely quick and successful customer service when I need it!
Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Joe Hopkins,"Tuesday, August 25, 2015","Elucentra by far has a superior service in providing a cloud hosting solution for QuickBooks products among many other solutions. As many people will tell you, the QuickBooks Online solution is convenient and the desktop version of QuickBooks is powerful in its full functionality and reporting capabilities. So..... why not combine the power of both!!! Elucentra provide a conduit to host your QuickBooks desktop licensed software in a secure cloud environment with worry free backup and superfast server rendering. As a matter of fact, I was able to run a 2014 QuickBooks Enterprise connection with my Mac Air laptop using my hotspot connection on my cell phone while sitting in a Home Depot parking lot. If I had any issues, I would typically send Elucentra an email and my problem was resolved within a few minutes. The support staff is friendly & personable. As Chief Financial Officer for multiple companies I worked 1st hand with Elucentra to convert five separate software versions of QuickBooks that resided on 5 different city desktop locations all into one version of QuickBooks Enterprise. We were able to assign user access right for specific individuals to one or more databases as needed.  I am able to view in real time all the accounting data from each location while still giving the localized accounting staff in remote cities the ability to do the daily accounting work. You don't have to be a large organization to reap the benefits of the online server environment. Go ahead and take that Caribbean vacation and login using a remote computer... you deserve a break.  With a little advanced notice they can have a new virtual server spun up for you in a few hours and import your backup QuickBooks file (depending on the size) within another hour or so of sending them the data file. To my knowledge they still support the month to month service commitment. So you can quit anytime, no questions asked. But believe me... once your on.... there will be no reason to get off. You will have a few questions during the first couple of weeks such as setting up the simple slave printers & setting up the invoice & reporting email system to use your current email server. Other than that it is a very simplistic and user friendly experience. Good luck on your remote number crunching in the mean time!"
Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Dustin Holzberger,"Sunday, March 1, 2015","I searched for a solution for hosting my QuickBooks Enterprise Edition for the past few years but for the money it just did not seem to make good fiscal sense.  Plus there always seem to be ad on services that kept pushing the price further out of reach.  Today, I have Elucentra Cloud Services.  Its twice as fast as when I had QuickBooks on my own network and the staff has all been Johnny on the spot with any questions or need I have.  Excel was included and it works with my hosted tax solution called Avalara.  Great solution and I could not be happier."

Elucentra Cloud Services,www.elucentra.com,Audrey,"Friday, October 17, 2014","I just wanted to take a moment to share with you my experience with Elucentra.  We are a small business with only a few employees; however, our employees do not work in the same location.  We were transferring accounting files back and forth and sometimes would get it wrong and end up sending or updating an old version and then we'd have to redo everything.  I was looking for a means of everyone having access and being able to work in the same data files at all times.  It had to be accessible 24/7 not only for the data but also for support.  When I came across Elucentra and you advertised 24/7/365 support via live chat and very little down time, I was skeptical.  It ""felt"" expensive for us since we are small, but thought I would give it a try.  I have been so thankful that I did. I cannot tell you the peace of mind I have knowing everyone's in the same files and that when I am up and working at 3 a.m. or on the weekends, I don't have to worry with whether I have the latest information and knowing any changes I make my employees also have access to.  Your customer support has been outstanding.  I have literally chatted with people at 3 a.m. and on weekends....all hours... and someone is always quick to respond and solve whatever issues I may be experiencing (many of which are just my lack of understanding...not really software issues).  You have an outstanding staff and product.  I would not hesitate to recommend you to anyone and  have already done so."

After 3   weeks of trying to get my sites working on their system with NO help what-so-ever, I was finally forced to move to Go Daddy.

They just put me on hold saying their technicians are looking into the problem. A colleague recommended Hitech Cloud to me. The setting up and migration of my data was smooth and quick. Even after that they have been really helpful and all the problems that come up are solved instantaneously. The servers run well with hardly any downtime. It has been excellent working with them so far. Now that its been 6 months with them I only hope that they maintain their quality of service in future also.

Superb was monitoring my server, so I received an email and text telling me. 20 minutes later I got a call from a data center from their team who helped me get back online without me having to do anything.

TrackVia,www.trackvia.com,Jim,"Monday, November 24, 2014","At first everything seemed good, they have a product we wanted to use. We wanted to add about 150 users, so we would be a big account and assumed customer service would be stellar. We couldnt have been more wrong. From the sales staff to technical support, they were horrible, demanding, and condescending. Our service rep Bill acted more like a used car salesman than a professional. What Lisa from DeleGates review said was correct, your feel like they are doing you a favor. If you dont respond to a voice mail, or dont reply to an email within a couple of days, youll get scolded and patronized. I think they forget they need the customers more than customers need them. Unfortunately were still looking for a similar service, any recommendations? This is a classic non-customer focused company!"
TrackVia,www.trackvia.com,Lisa,"Tuesday, June 24, 2014","In the initial stages of going to TrackVia we incurred problems with a rather rude, none customer focused, insensitive 'boy' whom couldn't understand that the person he was dealing with in our company (the Director) had unfortunately had to take time off work due to family commitments and couldn't take their calls.  In fact the exact words were 'if you cannot make a future call, it is imperative that you let us know ahead of time.  We have many other customer appointments scheduled throughout the day, and a no show throws our schedule off....'We had hoped after reading reviews to go ahead with TrackVia and get a good working relationship with them as we have many customers who will in time be requiring their services/system."

I have used Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Google Drive, and Sheets. The only app I have yet to try is Slideshow. But all office product applications are as good or better than any Microsoft brand office software. The absolutely best part of Google, was their pioneering mainstreaming of cloud based storage for all these applications. And their pioneering offer of amazingly large data storage amounts. The Gigabytes of memory that Google has offered through their products was unbelievably larger compared to paid competitors. The ease and security of Google has always made using these applications feel safe and secure for any professional use of their applications.   "

The home page is just juvenile, with the fat man dancing on the front and the 'chat' pop up that takes forever to open. All of the ridiculous add-ons and videos take time to load, precious time that I could be working. Thankfully, the iPhone app doesn't have all of that crap on it but it also detracts from my copy-and-paste abilities and I have to type out phone numbers.

Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,Dan Griffin,"Friday, January 16, 2015","I never write reviews, i took the time to write this one because nobody should have to go through having to deal with appointment plus. i have been using this website for about 2 years and ive seen a constant 1-star level of service.Pros: -its cheap for the basic serviceCons: -poor customer service-when entering information in the customer info page, if you enter more data than the field is capable of handling and submit changes, it will report that the data have been recorded successfully but it will get cut off-site frequently slows to a crawl for 15min to an hour, or even stops working completely-a problem with the site (appointments not appearing in month view) was brought to their attention and took 3 months to get fixed-the document upload feature costs $1 per MB per month... ill say it again.... $1 / PER MEGABYTE / PER MONTH! (dropbox is the equivalent of $1 / per YEAR / per 1048576 megabytes)-there are tons of arbitrary rules that dont make any sense, for example only 3 customer notes will appear in an appointment window, even if you have more than 3 customer notes-scheduling interface is hard to use, not hard to understand, but hard to physically use, if you change certain data fields like service, it will default all of your other settings to default, if you dont change the settings in the correct order-exporting reports to excel will obfuscate data fields, customer data rows will not line up with their respective columns. this was brought to their attention and i was told i was to blame, that there was a setting in my excel program that was causing the data to be delimited, no such setting exists-they refuse to provide you with a copy of your data. not even a database file. they tell you to export your data using the reports feature but NOT ALL OF YOUR DATA FIELDS ARE EXPORTABLE. when brought to their attention they did nothing about itso please, stay away from this program, unless you are a small mom and pop shop that has maybe 5-10 customers a week and cant afford the larger CRM subscriptions, and even then, know that you cannot retreive all of your data-Dan"

Appointment-Plus,www.appointment-plus.com,MM,"Thursday, February 6, 2014",I have had appointment plus since 2005. My business experienced a major loss in 2007 when all my customer information was overwritten by one customers information. App plus stated it was a very unlikely human error on their part and that the backups at their site were also corrupted so there was no way to retrieve information. I was given 3 months of service free and since then make my own backups regularly. Seemed to have a run of years with no problems and a reliable connection. Ever since mid-late 2013 something has gone horribly WRONG with App Plus!! The site is completely unreliable. I am embarrassed when I have to make clients stand and wait to book their next appointment or when we receive calls and have to ask them to bear with us as the site isn't working or is so slow. It has definitely caused me to provide poor customer service and I cannot even quantify the loss I experienced from the 2007 incident. Seriously considering searching for a new web based appointment company. I am extremely forgiving and will stick with something far too long when I know its not working. But I do get to the point when I know enough is enough. I am definitely there!

They did an ""enhancement"" and our appointments and customer records began duplicating. We complained for 3 months with no resolution. We even had been paying extra for tech support. We finally had to cancel the service about a month ago. They disabled our employee logins, but some of our customers had the appointment page bookmarked. The system continued to take appointments after we cancelled. We started having customers show up with confirmation emails but all of our kennels were full. It is almost impossible to get a live person on the phone to fix it. When you finally do, they argue with you. I do not wish Appointment-Plus on my worst enemies."

This issue went unresolved and my messages were not responded to for TWO WEEKS. This is what the company does...take reservations...and we couldn't do that for two weeks.

She always answered all of my questions and was a real joy to work with.The software is good, but there is a lot involved so really take time getting to learn the various features. Go over everything numerous times and write yourself some cheat sheets to refer back to. Thanks, Sarah, for all your help."
Bookafy,www.bookafy.com/serchen,Sarah Sund,"Monday, May 9, 2016","I recently had an issue with changing some of my settings on Bookafy and made my first call to the support line. I reached a young lady named Sarah. I've been in the service industry since the beginning of time (Im old) and Sarah provided perhaps the best customer service experience I've ever received. Sarah identified the problem as a system issue and immediately suggested a potential workaround. Not only did she suggest it, but she then logged into my account and made the changes, showed me the changes, and we were all set. She genuinely seemed to enjoy her job and helping me, and it came out in the service she provided. My first experience with Bookafy Customer Support made me glad I switched from the other company. Bookafy delivered and I am a happy camper! "
Bookafy,www.bookafy.com/serchen,Ivan Stanis,"Monday, May 9, 2016","Even though there are a few things I couldnt figure out right away... Jason was quick to assist with any method possible to help. He even logged into my wordpress website an installed the iframe code... no extra charge. Just good ol fashion customer service... going the extra mile!   Within hours, I was all set up and ready to go and still had the support to customize everything to my own company building greater relationships with my clients."
Bookafy,www.bookafy.com/serchen,Kalin Good,"Monday, May 9, 2016",Strongly recommend! I'm so very impressed with this company. They are responsive and great towork with. They have anticipated every feature that I need and thought of almost everything! Thank you Bookafy.

Timely,www.gettimely.com/,K. jensen ,"Monday, February 15, 2016",I have searched all over the Internet for a great online booking software for my mobile company. Mobile Beauty Team is so happy to finally have a program that works so well and is very easy to use.I love seeing all the new updates and o can't wait to see the Android /Windows App ( currently only available for iPhone users) My team loves this program as well thanks Timley 
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,Heather White,"Friday, January 15, 2016","We found Timely after already investing in another salon system. Unfortunately it became clear very quickly that it just wouldn't work for us, so we did some research and Timely kept popping up. We spoke to the fabulous Neil in the London office and we were up and running in two days. Their proactive approach to functionality, communication and all round client service is second to none. The information we have at our finger tips is relevant, the system is intuitive to use and has features that we simply could not do without now. We ? Timely! "
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,Charles Clarke,"Wednesday, January 13, 2016","I have used a few other systems in my salon but they were costly, kept freezing and just didn't give me the control of my business that they claimed. I found timely and have not looked back! Fantastic system, easy to use, has all the features of other systems and more, is a fraction of the cost and has no contracts!Interested? Make sure to tell them I sent you! Oh, and you can sell gift vouchers on your website too with timely! :)"
Timely,www.gettimely.com/,David,"Tuesday, January 12, 2016","Timely makes running my business easy! It's beautiful and simple to use (by far the easiest I've had). They have great support staff, who are friendly and really helpful. I also like that they're always adding new stuff like features that we've voted on! Timely has been a real lifesaver!"
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Louise Rose,"Monday, March 9, 2015","I subscribed to BookmyCity online booking about 2 months ago.  The technicians Nicole and Heather were wonderful, but the program itself is very cumbersome.  Their technical support group is very slow at making changes.   You cannot change an appointment time or reschedule without deleting and re-adding.  The company I am with now, you simply edit the time or grab and move it with the mouse.  When an employee wants a  period off, it was a very difficult process.  My clients that were booking were not able to book   After about 2 weeks of constant chats and phone calls, they discovered there was a ""bug"" in the system.   Therefore I would not recommend this company for an easy software service for your clients to book online   It was  far more work than our simple manual spreadsheet that we had last year.  "
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Lucas,"Wednesday, November 5, 2014","I've received such positive feedback from my clients since joining BookMyCity. They love having the option of booking online, which helps me out too because it's saving me time. It stores all of their info for me which has really improved my customer service."
BookMyCity,www.bookmycity.com,Trumell Duncan,"Wednesday, November 5, 2014","BookMyCity support team helped me set up my account, migrate all of my bookings/client data, and taught me how to use the system. I hardly had to do any work. It's been a pretty painless process so far!"
ServiceCEO,www.serviceceo.com,Bob,"Friday, July 31, 2015",Worst site ever. Been on hold for 15 mins with no human  to talk to. Software is beyond slow and unreliable. I want out of my contract so bad. To have to ask a client to sit and wait while you are trying to just load a new webpage on ServiceCeo. WORST COMPANY EVER!
ServiceCEO,www.serviceceo.com,Martin Thirlwell,"Tuesday, March 3, 2015","This product was excellent to start with our corporate office recommended  it and it was great.  However in the passed 12 months it has become slow and unreliable, they insist they are trying to correct it but we have been waiting 5 months and still it is slow, specifically when searching the database.  Still a good product but too slow, we have been using this system for 3 years but I am not sure how much longer we can put up with the lack of progress."

WorkWave Fleet,www.workwave.com,Nan Ma,"Monday, June 1, 2015","Viamente is a very user friendly and easy to pick up tool. Compared with different routing tools we used in the past, Viamente is much simpler but as same powerful. Lot of times, it just can generate more efficient routes. I like almost all features of it. I can use it to solve different types of routing problems, ie. pick up and delivery, build existing, multiple depots, balance work across a week, collect bigger loads using its importance function, different vehicle types, traffic profile, speed factor, drag and drop, change comparison, etc. You can use Viamente just anywhere where you have internet, there is no software installation required. I can work with company computer or work at home, just anywhere. The Viamente team is very service oriented, responsible and expert in this area. We enjoy this software just from all angles."
WorkWave Fleet,www.workwave.com,John Vestus,"Wednesday, November 13, 2013","Viamente is a lifesaver product. Before using it myself, I found my schedule packed and exhausting. After using it and letting it organize my routes, I have more free time than I ever imagined. A must have for anyone."
10to8,www.10to8.com,Sam Deeks,"Friday, February 12, 2016","Comments: The 10to8 software is a fantastic tool for anyone who has customers who have appointments with you and your business. The online diary works really well enabling customers to choose their own time to see you without the hassle of speaking to anyone. My booking page is linked directly to my website making booking simple. Every customer that visits my practice compliment us on our professionalism when it comes to good communication with them. All my customers are contacted at least twice before they actually visit our premises, once to confirm their appointment then a day before their appointment they will receive another text/e mail to remind them of their visit to us. This cuts down on the amount of patients that do not turn up on their allotted sessions. More often than not patients just forget. This is now a thing of the past. We also like the fact that 10to8 is linked to our social media pages. This helps us to promote our business in many ways."

"Roadnet Technologies, Inc",www.roadnet.com ,Dave,"Monday, July 4, 2016","Our company switched to Roadnet a while ago. What a joke. Same stops every week, but it gets run in a different sequence every week.  If the first initial week was supposed to be the most efficient and shortest way, why is being run a different way again and again? Customers are getting upset because our drivers are showing up at different times each week. Our company has let the drivers that run the routes make changes to the roadnet schedule. They have decreased miles and run time. "

Could not have done it without this system. Now running 5 schools and 8 instructors and growing every day. Booked solid 90 days in advance- everyone prepays. PayPal loves us. Don't ever change.

At this point I can give a good review. My site has been up and running constantly and the speed seems to be good. I've written technical support a few times regarding non-urgent matters (questions about how to white-list emails etc..) and each time I got a reply within a few hours. I find communication to be one of the most important things so I gave them 5 stars because of it. The 'pros' for me are: price, the easy to use control panel, and the quick replies.As for the 'cons' there really hasn't been any. At first I didn't  like their email server but once I understood settings could be made in the control panel - it was problem solved."

Host ASP,www.HostASP.net,Pankaj Nikam,"Friday, October 19, 2012",I have been using the HOSTASP.NET Services for the past year. A fact to tell you is they are a really helpful company who can help you get the best out of the hosting plans. Their customer care service simply rocks. Support is the best thing about this company. Getting a great service from them is a pleasure indeed. The panel is also good for setting up your websites. Now they also support ASP.NET 4.5 which is a great thing as very few hosting providers have support for it (currently). I give my 5 stars to this company!
Host ASP,www.HostASP.net,Padam Kafle,"Wednesday, October 3, 2012",The service is really remarkable. I have been with Host ASP since Feb 2012. All the issues are closed on time and service is also very good. Hope things will be remain same in future.

ASPHostCentral.com,www.asphostcentral.com,Marcus P,"Monday, October 12, 2015","I purposely spend a bit of my time here to write a small review about this host. This is based on my 2-years experience with them. I run a small e-store using nopCommerce and at that time, I really found difficulties finding a decent host that supports nopCommerce. Most of the hosts out there support a PHP-based ecommerce store and luckily, I can find this host for supporting my asp.net ecommerce store. I signed up and my site was up in just 4 hours. I then started to upload my products to their server and I can tell that I did not experience any issue with it.

The assets are searchable and we are able to train our internal and external clients to self-serve, which puts a lot more of our valuable time back in our hands. "
MediaValet,Write a review,Adele Kozlowski,"Monday, December 7, 2015","After having trials with other brands it was clear to us who had the better product and just so happened to be within budget. MediaValet has been incredible, during our decision process, we didn't feel pressure to close the deal or ""hurry up"". We were walked through all areas and even had great customer support during our trial with Sanjay. After moving forward with MediaValet, Raja, and Rob have been incredible. Rob has helped us through every step of implementation and has taken the overwhelming task of transferring our data from an FTP site and renaming items, to making it a feasible task that has been faster than expected. The support we receive on a weekly basis during our weekly phone call for implementation has exceeded my expectations. They truly care about the customer and their product is  easy to use, intuitive for all user levels (which is something we needed), has unlimited users and are transparent. We believed so much in their product that we signed a 2 year agreement and will most likely continue our relationship with them. After running trials with other DAMS with more ""add-ons"" I was running into issues with the site actually working. With MediaValet it was consistent, no down time, errors, and as an admin, uploading more than half a TB onto their cloud has been smooth. Best DAM system out there."
MediaValet,Write a review,Mark wesling,"Friday, May 2, 2014","Excellent DAMS, what separate's them from the pack is the personal touch they have with their clients.

I am very displeased with their service. I write to you as a warning. For the sake of your sanity and you money, DO NOT DEPOSIT or WITHDRAW any money into this service! They will flat out rob you. I have read the warning from other people and didn't listen. But the warning is REAL. DON'T MESS WITH THESE GUYS, THEY WILL ROB YOU.

So in fact, Coinbase used my money to buy BTC, rode the price up, then canceled the transaction, keeping the profit. Nice work if you can get it."

StarChapter,Write a review,Kelly Sweeten,"Thursday, August 11, 2016","     Our chapter had been struggling with trying to maintain a Joomla website and hosting service. The decision was made to look for alternative solutions. Looking at other various PMI chapters webstie, Starchapter was seen as a service most commonly being used. A Google search for Startchapter Reviews showed positive reviews by PMI chapter presidents. An attempt was made to reach out to a Chapter President to verify the review which resulted in a verification of the review by that Chapter President.       Our experience with the transition has been equal to the reviews seen online. Starchapter worked with our technical team to gather requirements, setup an initial design, test the site, and then go live. All this within 6 weeks. We transitioned to the new site in the middle of the month just before a breakfast meeting. No major issues were identified. Although not required, we had limited reach back to our Starchapter project manager during our first week which helped with a few important issues that came up. Since then, we use the Ticket support process and have had all our minor to major issues resolved in a timely manner.       Any chapter of PMI, or other NPOs looking to offload hosting management and Content Management Software (CMS) to another organization should give Starchapter serious consideration. Time our members have to volunteer is a limited resource to manage and prioritize. Starchapters services allows us to put our resources and time into planning strategic growth which would have normally been spent working on technical issues related to hosting services or CMS.      Thank you Starchapter for a great team of people who helped make our transition seamless and without interruption to our chapters services.  v/rKelly Sweeten, PMP Director of Communications, PMI North Alabama Chapter"

My very preliminary assessment is StarChapter is a very good application and support, whether classes or via chat, is excellent. I am trying figure out if StarChapter can replace eStudio. The only feature that StarChapter seems to lack is a document repository. If someone could let me know if StarChapter can replace eStudio entirely and if not, what features are lacking so I can make other accommodations such as using Google Forms for documents, I would appreciate it.

Before we tried other applications but we had to use several software to commit different operations e.g. payment processing, parts management etc. Autorepair cloud has all necessary features, so we removed all other software. It is simple, easy to use and support is great. "
AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,James,"Tuesday, June 28, 2016","I switched to autorepair cloud 3 month ago after 4 years of using repair shop solution. Me and my team realized that we need something multifunctional as our shop is growing. So, Ive made a small research and compared auto repair shop management systems. I have to admit there a tons of them, and its really hard to select the one. First of all Ive made a list of operations that we want to automate in our repair shop.  Then I compared most popular software with features we need and it seemed to me that Autorepiar cloud is price performance ratio. One of the most important thing is that it is simple to use. Customers are able to request an appointment with mobile application which means that our shop is visible to thousands of potential customers. So far we like autorepair cloud, good job guys!"
AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,Frank Bored,"Wednesday, June 15, 2016","Good application for those who knows the value of time.  AutoRepair cloud is all-in-one software with simple interface. I took only several hours to learn how to work with it. All features are completely useful in every day operations: appointment schedule, work order managements, labor estimates, auto parts management and more over it has integration to our accounting system QuickBooks. "
AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,Bob,"Tuesday, June 14, 2016",The  software is great for such low price! AutoRepair Cloud is awesome application for medium size shops. The interface is user-friendly and all features are easy to use. And they update it quite frequently. I would recommend Autorepair cloud for shop owners.

Its a good application with all necessary functions to run auto repair shop. I tried several automotive software in my shop but this one is really useful. There is a special mobile application for my customers which gives more options to communicate.  
AutoRepair Cloud,www.autorepaircloud.com,David Thiruman,"Tuesday, June 7, 2016","Its fairly easy to use, many helpful features, good customer service. Auto repair cloud has a lot of features for its price, e.g. labor estimates, auarts management, appointments schedule etc.Though some features missing / configuration is not flexible enough, for example unable to change options on invoices.Altogether I do like the software better than the one I used before, because it has much more features and I would definitely recommend it to others"

Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Sunny Sethi,"Tuesday, June 14, 2016",We have been working with EaseCentral for a year now. It was a great decision to move. The customer service from EC team has been awesome. We moved because we needed a user friendly system. The old system we had was hard to navigate and also was difficult to maintain rates.EC has a great Rate Library that makes it easy for us to build a new group in the system quickly. They do update the rates on that so it makes life much easier for us. We hope they will soon add a COBRA providers so the termination information can be sent to the COBRA admin quickly.  We like the fact that they keep adding new features and the system capabilities are increasing every month.Overall we have been very happy with EaseCentral.
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Jodi Hansen,"Thursday, June 2, 2016","Marc Jacobson & Associates has been using EaseCentral for over 5 years.   Our job is to make sure the financial security of our clients and their employees is set, and everything we do supports that, or we dont do it.  EaseCentral supports it!  We have watched it metamorphosed into an incredible tool that we use with over 150 clients on a daily basis.  Our clients and employees love it for the ease and accessibility nationwide.  The team of engineers and staff are fantastic to work with and are constantly producing webinars and other tools.  The customer service is outstanding!  We are looking forward to the integration of the payroll platform and new features that come every quarter!  Great product!"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Bradley Vaccaro,"Wednesday, June 1, 2016","I think the most accurate rating here is 4.5 stars. I researched numerous alternatives to provide online benefits enrollment to Allpointe's clients, and EaseCentral was the most flexible and provided the best value. The half-star dock would be for the lack of full integration with payroll and other platforms. But I rounded up because every single month for the last year, EaseCentral has added and improved features to improve the experience for the broker, client admins and employees... with many more on the way. We have about 35 clients on the portal, and are adding more on a regular basis."
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Danny Firestone,"Thursday, May 26, 2016","We've worked with Ease Central since 9/2015. They have delivered exactly what was promised. The ability for our team to quickly install a case within a couple of days, VS months with other vendors has given us the edge to win cases immediately. We love the fact that we can customize the system on the fly rather than sending out a ticket and waiting for our CSR's from other company's to get to it when we arrive in their queues. When we've encountered issues or needed support, we not only got quick responses, but the EC team has even implemented changes that we recognized were needed for us and our fellow agents. This is the BEST bang for your buck that you will find. We can't speak highly enough of the Ease Central system and the team that supports it. I've even gotten calls from our support rep when she was in a taxi on her way home from the airport at 9pm. If that isn't good service, I don't know what is!"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Steve Vilas,"Thursday, May 26, 2016","We've worked with Ease Central for nearly a year now and have nearly 40 clients using the platform.  We've found it easy to set-up, and it's very easy for employees to use.  Ease Central has done an excellent job of putting together a strong support team, and is consistently adding features and tools to make the system more comprehensive and easier to use.  It doesn't do everything - integrations/feeds are still a work in process - but Ease Central is truly one of the easiest systems - and best values - one can offer clients"
Ease Central,www.easecentral.com,Harry Gousha,"Thursday, February 25, 2016","I have had EaseCentral for a couple of months and it is very broker intensive, with brokers doing most of the work.  EaseCentral is not at all intuitive and necessitates hours of study, listening to videos and asking questions.  I am currently try to do a look-back measurement period for ACA - so my client can do the necessary reporting and we are struggling with how to date the start of the measurement period in 2015.  Just one of many issues.  I must say that their support team is outstanding, at least in their efforts to resolve my many issues."
Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Dave Ferreira,"Monday, June 20, 2016",Tower Watson conducts business in a very profitable way for themself.

Towers Watson,www.towerswatson.com,Russ Rathjen,"Wednesday, March 23, 2016","Towers Watson is an awful company. Untrained and uneducated customer service representatives. But it is not the employees fault that Towers Watson is such a terrible company.....it is Towers Watson executives who make decisions to NOT help customers, especially with reimbursements.

InfinityHR,www.infinity-ss.com,Andrew,"Wednesday, March 5, 2014",So I just started with PRMI which is a great company but they use InfinityHR for their benefits.  I looked at the different plans and printed the benefit summary for the plan I signed up for.  Now that my coverage is active I called UnitedHealthCare before making appointments and I found out some of the information in the benefit summary from InfinityHR is incorrect.  Now I have to lookup what I actually signed up for through the UHC website which is ridiculous.  I worked for an insurance company for 10 years prior to this and I don't see how a company who is paid strictly to manage another companies benefits can't get it right.  It shows a major lack of competence.
InfinityHR,www.infinity-ss.com,Kirk Davis,"Thursday, November 21, 2013",We decided to use Infinity HR to help manage our benefits last year.  I have been more than pleased with their performance.  Our benefits administration is in much better shape now and Infinity's services have proven to be very well priced.

gotoBilling,Write a review,Grace Johnson,"Thursday, April 28, 2016",Go to Billing is a very easy and reliable service.   Site is always up running.  Easy to operate and great for customers who do not wish to give their credit card information out due to security issues.  When that occurs I always send them and invoice and they log in from their end to the site and pay the invoice with their information.  This wonderful system then sends me an email advising the customer has paid the invoice and I can then ship my customer his or her order with no hassle.  I also love that we can store multiple credit cards in the systems data base so we do not have to enter all the information each time the customer makes a payment.  Another great feature is that the customer automatically gets his receipt emailed to him and I don't have to send it separately.  I truly love this system and would not want to change to any other.

BQE BillQuick,www.BQE.com,Carla,"Monday, May 7, 2012","I've now used BillQuick at two different companies for the past ten years. I have been extremely satisfied with the ease of use. The customer service support is great when there are any problems, which is not very often. I recently had a problem with the database - Scott in the Customer Service department was so helpful and helped fix the problem right away. Several years ago we began using BillQuick to manage our invoicing, instead of only for time-tracking purposes. The company was extremely helpful throughout this transition process. Moving our invoicing efforts to BillQuick was a great decision, as it automated billing and made everything so much easier and more accurate. The solution saved me approximately five days each month."
BahaQuote,www.bahaquote.com,jessica,"Thursday, February 27, 2014","Template Based Invoicing. There is nothing better than the quote software that has template based on the quotations, proposals and forms creation and access to the catalog of its products through the mobile interface. Simply the best for me!"
BahaQuote,www.bahaquote.com,georginawebb,"Friday, January 24, 2014",The past year was less of worries and more research work towards enhancing the look of the store. With this comes one unique feature I have come across in my attempt to channelize my sales growth and that is distributor catalog support. This facilitates real time data flow directly from the distributor or the wholesaler. This makes the quotes transparent enough for my customer to asses every feature securely. Simply the best software anyone can get.
BahaQuote,www.bahaquote.com,wilhelminabarnes,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014",The automated content creation tools and content rules made me wonder why I never gave it a though earlier.

BahaQuote,www.bahaquote.com,Sonal Bundela,"Wednesday, November 27, 2013",The CRM manager is an essential component of Bahaquote quoting software. The list of customers asking for quotes is carefully filtered out the moment quotes are send to a prospective buyer or customer. This carefully filtered list appears in the drop down the moment I go into tracking of quotes sent to a particular customer. The drop down allows me to make the choice in one click and I can see the status then and there. It is web based so I dont have the fear of the loosing the data in any case. It happens quite effortlessly because of the Salesforce CRM integration which is flawless and prompt. This further helps in getting on-time approvals and sometime quite early in the process. This list further provides me avenues to nurture customer relationship. 
BahaQuote,www.bahaquote.com,Baha Quote,"Monday, November 25, 2013","I was very apprehensive initially as I never went for something offered online but it sound safer than going for installation software that might hamper my PC. Glad I went for quoting software accessible at Bahaquote.com that is one single package capable of handling varied tasks at a time. It solves the requirement of unlimited quotes, contains data import facility, full and no initial fee or contracts. They were providing it without charge for a 1 team member like me and so I took the leap simply in time. The package allows you to generate unlimited quotes with no hidden charges. Finally I am in with the tide. Thanks Bahaquote!"

Billings Pro for Mac,www.marketcircle.com/,Max,"Thursday, June 18, 2015",Billings PRO really sucks. The sync is absolutely broken. I lost a lot of billable hours due to sync issues.

My finances have been in good shape ever since I signed up for Invoicera. I've tried other apps too - more or less the same. Those are either too pricey or less featured. Invoicera by far has been my favorite.
Invoicera,www.invoicera.com,Alex Dickinson,"Tuesday, April 9, 2013","Invoicera is truly a great invoicing app. Two years ago, I was using separate applications for time & expense tracking, project management and for invoicing. But I'm happy to say that I found Invoicera which has not only helped me save hundreds of dollars every month but also improved my work efficiency. All the tasks of invoicing, time & expense tracking, project management I can do with only one App.     "
Invoicera,www.invoicera.com,Andrew,"Monday, December 12, 2011","We are a network of tech blogs and generally use Invoicera to send invoices to our clients for their advertisement assignments.

Ive provided documentation via POs and vendor numbers from the client and yet either Tungsten has an automated system that doesnt work or inept employees who do not read what is provided.
Tungsten Network,www.tungsten-network.com,TM,"Wednesday, January 21, 2015","Worst system ever, including customer service- limited understanding of the English language; continuously takes over 2 hours to submit 2 invoices each month (consisting of 2 line items); clearly does not read the support tickets submitted to try to resolve the entry issues; optional fields are required or they won't process your submission.

This improves the efficiency of the software as we are very specialized needs in marine maintenance.  The manager or the person in charge or the staff can look up work order history to make sure all work orders are completed. In our case the captain of each vessel creates these as needed. We have also pasted laminated QR Codes for our guests to enter work requests through the guest portal. This is great for feedback and more pressing issues that the Captain might not easily recognize through out the entire vessel.

ServerPronto,www.serverpronto.com,Jason Wheeler,"Wednesday, April 10, 2013","I have rented a dedicated server from ServerPronto for about 3 years now. The bottom line for me is that they have excellent uptime.  I can only recall 2 downtimes in those three years. One downtime was less than an hour, the other was ~3 hours. Their support is good via an online ticket system. The reason I gave them only 4 stars: 1) Their billing system is archaic and in order to change the credit card on file I have to open a ticket and submit the new credit card info in the ticket. This seems extremely insecure and I don't want their customer service agents having direct access to my credit card info. 2) They have no bandwidth meter to see how much bandwidth has been used. 3) When I signed up I was promised 15TB bandwidth. However, they only gave me 5TB. I literally went back and forth with them about 15 times with several different tickets and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau before they would honor their promise to give me 15TB. 4) Cancellation involves faxing copies of your drivers license and credit card. I put up with these things because their uptime is phenomenal."
ServerPronto,www.serverpronto.com,J. Albarracin,"Wednesday, March 13, 2013",I've been some months using ServerPronto and I have to say that they have a serious customer service support. You'll have your questions replied in less than 1h and you will get real help. Not the standard cut & paste answers you get everywhere else. I've been with other hosting services and this is the one that does not tie you to a long term contract or agreement. You pay as you go. And I want to go further with these guys. I give my best to ServerPronto.

ActiveReports Server,www.activereportsserver..,Colin Kraebel,"Friday, June 1, 2012","ActiveReports Server turned out to be just right for us. We realized that with ActiveReports Server, we could pay just for the server licenses we need today without having to worry about ancillary fees, and then add licenses as we need them. As a result, we can provide reporting features and related services to our customers now, and still allow our own evolving business situation to drive our pricing model. In addition, we found that ActiveReports Server was easy to deploy, and easy to configure with all of the security settings we needed.  One thing stood out - The very intuitive Web-based report designer. Compared to other report designers I have used in the past, ActiveReports Servers Web-based report designer is very intuitive. It understands the underlying database schema and data relationships and allows business users to do ad hoc reporting without knowing the underlying details.  Among other features, report scheduling was easy to set up and yet was sufficiently flexible for our needs. The security provider module allowed us to easily integrate with our in-house solutions.  Additionally they actually respond to customer ideas and input! I like how they allow their customers to submit feedback and ideas on their support portal and I can tell that they actually respond to those comments and make changes to the product based on them. I really appreciate the responsiveness of the product team."

I have been working with MAUS since December 2015. The last 9 months have been heavily invested in transferring everything from the last 15 years from a collection of servers to one location, and now i get to focus on all of the features of the suite and how we can utilize them going forward. The after sales care from the MAUS team is second to none! I am a perfectionist (to say the least), and I constantly am ringing the technical department for who, what, why, whens, and most importantly HOW. Almost every week in the last year I have had a conversation with Tony who has always been nothing but patient and honest, even though sometimes my patience has been short with him. The platform itself is very user friendly (If I can teach a 55 year old Cattle Truck Driver to use it, ANYONE can use it), and as they continue to update and add features it gets more and more business friendly.It feels very much that the whole platform was built just for me which is refreshing.Keep up the great work MAUS.Justine"

We utilize the system to track all communications for each lead so everyone is aware of what is happening which gives us higher accountability and helps catch anything that might have fallen through the cracks in the past.  Another huge advantage of the system is it's project management piece. We are able to create projects for our services that helps keep us on track for each engagement and community. You are also able to duplicate those projects so you aren't having to recreate the wheel each time a new engagement or community is started. "

This company is a small company who reacts on suggestions and learn from their customers. The most I like about them is that their CEO, Dan is a great guy.

WORKetc,Write a review,Nathan,"Tuesday, December 10, 2013","I did a CRM comparison using the top 10 products and added a few other interesting ones into the mix. After 2 months of trials & analysis. Worketc came out on top. Previous CRM: Salesforce. The main reasons we like WorkEtc: 1) Close integration with Google apps (which we use). It has over 240 reviews and is extremely well rated. 2) Killer built-in project management. 3) Everything else is the same as everyone else or better. 4) Complete package - no need for  ""marketplace"" apps to fill in product gaps. While I understand the ""marketplace"" model's value and use it successfully with Google apps, with Worketc all the core features I need are built-in. Salesforce uses this ""marketplace"" model and I have had mostly bad experiences. Google at least has solid products and is adding new features. The built-in Salesforce support ticketing, email tracking, and google integration was terrible. The installed apps I used to fill the product lag left me feeling like it was shoehorned and not usable. So far we have been using WorkEtc about 3 months, and it has greatly improved the transparency & organization of the company. I look forward to even more usage. One thing worth noting is it was relatively easy to migrate to WorkEtc considering it is a CRM that touches most parts of the company. Our rollout is being managed on top of our normal work-load & going well. WorkEtc support is extremely helpful in guiding us for  best practices. Best of luck with selecting a CRM, I know it is not easy. Hopefully this information will help."

Refused.Customer service is horrible.   It seems like they are only interested on the bottom line.  Make sure the contract explains in detail what options you have to break the contract if their system is not compatible. They will tell you it is but then things don't work as they are suppose to.

Support is terrible, Some of their employees don't know how to do things in their own system.

Bizagi,www.bizagi.com,Uldis Tukans,"Thursday, June 4, 2015","I have used Bizagi Modeler which is part of Bizagi BMP Suite. This is great tool to create and describe different kind of processes and flows.The biggest advantage what I have found very useful is automatic documentation creation in different formats like PDF, MS Word, etc. It saves a lot of time and effort, especially if additional corrections are required in existing process model and appropriate documentation must be updated as well.Another good thing is that system warns you about some incorrect steps what you are trying to make during procecess modelling, it helps to keep integrity of model as such.One minor issue could be related to restrictions for ""gateway"" used in process flow where gateway should be used either to split apart the flow or to merge together, both behaviours in the same gateway are not supported. This causes to use more gateways to handle specific cases thus process flow becomes more complicated."

They are honest, fast and their professionalism goes outside the bounds. In fact, I never waited more than 30 minutes, even when submitting support tickets at 3 or 4 in the morning on weekends. They've provided more than what I need. Domain registration is a few dollars too high - $8.9 for .com TLD (if you're doing bulk domains especially), but that's my only complaint. Thanks Fozzy for everything!"

I have several accounts with them, and they continue to impress!Go with them, they are good! "

I have never had such a high level of support from a host before. These guys bend over backwards and go out of their way to assist. The only reason I have contacted support is due to questions about setting things up, and I should say they were very fast and helpful, explained me every important thing I needed to know.Excellent pricing for a lot of room and features, very fast server, great and known cPanel with a load of features plus daily backups. I feel confident that my site is up and fast running at all times. This is also due to their stable servers, fast speed connectivity and good work of their staff."

I have to give credit to this host they take their customers first and go extra miles to fix anything for you even if it is caused by your negligence. They just want to keep you happy.Speed connectivity is really fast from all server connections - I like it very much.

Fozzy,Write a review,Jimmy Currathers,"Monday, December 14, 2015","I have signed up with Fozzy.com and would like to tell you about the quality of service they provide. It has been a great host for me. It is very difficult for me to find words to express my feelings about their excellent support  these guys are very friendly and responsive.Vitally important fact is that they use Litespeed server that is over 6 times faster than Apache web server.

Fozzy,Write a review,Logan Matters ,"Thursday, October 22, 2015","What I want to say that I'm thankful a lot to my friend Alex who recommended me to choose Fozzy.com and their ssd hosting services. Their prices are great but not the cheapest - you will get what you pay for without any doubt. Their website is convenient that you can an opportunity to choose from servers in US, EU, RU and IN - a great plus for their team. Moreover, they use Litespeed server that is faster than ordinary Apache - my websites load very fast (I like it very much and my visitors also like this). All I can say is that everything works with this decent ssd web host. Recommend it to other webmasters and newbies looking for professional web host with helpful 24/7 customer support."
GlowHost,Write a review,Gianna Williams,"Thursday, February 25, 2016",I consider myself a beginning developer and utilize both WordPress and Joomla to create sites for several small customers. Every challenge that I've thrown at Glowhost they have QUICKLY fixed despite my low level knowledge.
GlowHost,Write a review,Joan Garcia,"Monday, August 17, 2015","I must rate GlowHost at 100% and would rate at 200% if I could. I have used them since April 2015. Since 1997, I changed web hosts almost yearly due to bad service, annoyance and arrogance with my support calls! The big turn off was most web hosts tripled renewal prices and wouldnt allow monthly payments. I spent a long time reading reviews before finding GlowHost.GlowHost blows me away! The rapid response to my support tickets is in a few minutes. With my many pre-sales questions, support people always courteously responded! I had a very serious issue with my web forms not working correctly in the database. Each one of the Technical Analysts attempted to help me find a solution while never showing impatience or arrogance. Plus all help desk tickets ended with: Let us know if you need further help! I felt like I was part of a big family, which is rare! Finally realizing that it was my fault for entering incorrect info, I apologized to the Technical Analysts! Also, when I ask for a recommendation on shopping cart or other software, the Technical analysts present a list of suggestions!Yesterday, while testing all my domains email accounts, I had serious send/receive issues with a POP email client I use. I thought GlowHosts servers were the problem. After changing passwords for all email accounts, send/receive problems remained. Using a GlowHosts  suggestion for a POP email client, my email accounts worked. The problem was really the POP email client I had used. So, if anyone out there is searching for a web host with quick responses and is reliable, knowledgeable and friendly, I would highly recommend GlowHost!"
GlowHost,Write a review,Rafael Sepulveda,"Monday, June 29, 2015","I am a photographer. Not much of a tech guy. So hosting my own website can get tedious. But with the Glowhost tech support, I get immediate responses, no matter what time of day. They are quick to respond and happy to help. That, along with fair pricing, is why I've been a customer since 2003."

The server stopped working once but after 11 Minutes they fixed the problem and even upgraded the hardware at no extra charge! Best support ever! They will help you with anything be it Scripts, Billing, or the server itself. If you have a problem. They will be there to help you. And for what you get, the prices are fantastic. Lots of companies charge a lot more for a lot less.I highly recommend GlowHost. I plan on being with them a long time."
GlowHost,Write a review,D. N. Brown,"Wednesday, July 2, 2014","I have been looking for a time-tested web host for my new web site for about 3 weeks. It was not an easy thing to do I must say as there are so many web host in the hosting market claiming they are the best. After reading good reviews on GlowHost and getting to know they had been providing hosting services since 2002, I decided to give them a try. Rock solid control panel, it is complete-useful-easy-to-use control panel. Support tickets are always answered promptly and clarification provided whenever needed.They offer 99.9% uptime guarantee - they are honest on this. My site is up and running. I like their free bonuses such as anti-spam and anti-virus, pre-installed scripts, domain registration, etc.GlowHost could double their price and I would stay with them. Excellent web hosting service would definitely recommend to others."
GlowHost,Write a review,Sandra Barese,"Tuesday, January 14, 2014","Like most I did the research and spent hours looking at reviews for the various hosts. Finally decided to give GlowHost a try. I have had experience with several hosting companies as most have over the last 5 years or so, and this is the best one I have been associated with. They've handled every ticket quickly, and with the responses you'd want from the very start. Very professional in approach and follow up. Their package prices also amazed me. My sites where all transferred free and everything went smooth. My business has grown as a direct result of the service and support Glowhost experts offer."
GlowHost,Write a review,Afrodille Herve,"Thursday, November 14, 2013","I needed an inexpensive, yet reliable host for my new project.  I did some research by googling around and finally decided I would contact GlowHost via telephone after reading their reviews and what others were saying about them. I waited approximately 30 seconds before being connected to a sales agent. I had a list of questions as long as my arm waiting for him. But as fast as I read them off, he answered them completely and without hesitation. That pretty much sold me on them. To date, I'm happy with the performance and reliability of the service. GlowHost is what I would consider to be an extremely proficient web host and usually manages to answer support tickets in 10 minutes or less every time I have had to put a ticket in to their support.  I've had no issues with uptime, and speed upload of my sites is pretty fast and I am on one of the cheaper plans that they offer. Alexander, Andrew and David are all super helpful guys (though I am sure there are more) and I have even seen Matt (I think he is the owner) answering tickets. If you need reliable hosting service along with helpful, responsive customer support, then this is one place I can recommend to those looking for a new host.  Good job GlowHost!"
GlowHost,Write a review,Dmitriy Machushenko,"Thursday, July 18, 2013","Been with GlowHost over 7 years. Nothing to complain about. The Support service is noticably fast (minutes) and accurate.  They are quick with their responses and seem to be very reliable. The uptime with them is great, I rarely have any downtime, or lag. Well, the features fit my needs perfectly. Sometimes saving a couple bucks a month isn't the best deal. I'm actually paying nearly half what I used to pay my old host and I'm getting much more for my money now. They are extremely knowledgeable and very patient, GlowHost has been outstanding to work with."
GlowHost,Write a review,Victor Pare,"Friday, June 14, 2013","It took much time for me to find the most reliable host for my web site. After reading some good feedback about glowhost.com I finally decided to give them a try as I was almost tired of searching a web host. All I can say they provide really good hosting and also support service. I use the site to run my business and check e-mail on it everyday, and the network performance is about as fast as any of the other services out there, but for about half the price. Well, tech support replies to my tickets within 10 minutes and explains everything to me. I like it. The admin interface is great, webmail works perfectly, and POP3 mail is quick to connect and download emails into OE. Thats what I call professional hosting service. So far so good."
GlowHost,Write a review,Jenush Thenisky,"Tuesday, May 28, 2013","I have been using their service for a long time and can express the point that Glowhost is a solid hosting provider with services that can scale. I haven't tried their new cloud stuff, but I am excited to try it when I have a little extra money, it sounds really cool. Their ticket support has always been very helpful. They are always available for my questions and they are quick to respond. I would rate them as a very reliable service and the price is right. Overall, Glowhost is a great host that I would recommend. My site is always up and running."

The only reason I can't give 5 stars is that there has been a bug with their live chat that multiple people come on and one messages that if you don't get a response you have been disconnected.

Servers run extremely well, and if you have an issue they make sure it gets fixed instead of letting you wait for a few days just to confirm a problem exists like some bad hosts do. The people on live chat have all been very nice and helpful, and whenever it isn't up, the support ticket response time is pretty fast. And the Modpacks (which they actually have unlike some) update all the time when possible. Great pricing too, I'm not sure how much better they can get!!!"

1&1 Internet,www.1and1.com,Brett,"Thursday, December 18, 2014","Horrid. I started my relationship with a salesperson, whose name is escaping me, and we decided on the basic 69.99 platform. This would allow me to get my feet wet with their company. He requested a Credit Card number to be kept on file. I directly posed the question ""Will you be charging this card now?""... He respond with a confident ""No, you will not be charged until you review the site and sign off on it.""... This was a black and white dialogue, no room for a communication mishap. No more than 24 hrs later, a 99.99 charge is found on my credit card from their company. Wait a second; Didn't he assure me that I wouldn't be charged... Furthermore, 99.99??? What in the world is that figure? After a call to my salesperson, he explained that they mistakenly set me up for the 99$ platform... He requested a refund on the 99.99 charge, but first required me to contact my bank and get as much information regarding the charge... A Month or so  transpires, I sign off on the website, all should be well... Wrong. Another charge of 99 appears... They neglected to revert back to the original 69 dollar platform. A Snapfu on their end, again... Since then communication with my salesperson has been non existent. I have received 2 more 99 dollar charges... I've spent an accumulated 2 hours on hold with the company and I have been transferred to the wrong department numerous times. Sounds like a bunch of thugs are working for this company, with the occasional well spoken rep... Please do not waste your time. "

1&1 Internet,www.1and1.com,ETH,"Monday, November 12, 2012","The 1&1 experience started off well, but when I had trouble uploading new files, that experience slowly began to sour and eventually resulted in the sort of customer service battle that I usually hear other people involved in. I ended my [approximately] 2 year relationship with 1&1 webhosting in October 2012 after developing a problem using their Control Panel -- for the third time. The first time, there was a Control Panel upgrade, and technical support was good enough to walk me through accessing my files via a work-around into the ""old"" control panel.  Inconvenient, but do-able. The second time that I had a problem accessing/uploading files, tech support advised that I was using a newer version of Mozilla than they were compatible with.  I had to switch off some add-ons; again inconvenient, but do-able. In September 2012, I was unable to access my files through Control Panel using either IE9 or Mozilla.  I ended up with the screen: System Requirements The system requirements are not met for this application!WebspaceExplorer requires a more current browser, such as Internet Explorer 6.0 or above (Windows) or Firefox. JavaScript must be enabled.  This page cannot be displayed when the resolution is less than 1024 x 768 pixels.I emailed tech support: ""I get this using these two browsers:Mozilla Firefox 7.0.1 (Javascript enabled checked)IE 9.08112.16421  (active scripting enabled)So, what is the solution? I forgot to advise them my monitor was set to 1920x1080.  I am not a computer genius, but I failed to understand why the monitor resolution had anything to do with it.  They wrote back and told me to change the monitor setting to 1024x768, which I did, accomplishing nothing. Over the next week or so, I was able to access files on a very sporadic basis, perhaps 10% of the times I tried, which makes it difficult maintaining a website and its blog page! I resolved to change webhost providers, did some research, changed my 1&1 payment option from PayPal to credit card (just in case! more on this later), and signed on with a new provider about two weeks before my 1&1 contract expiration in October 2012. Once the domain changed over, I attempted to cancel 1&1 by email, but was advised to call one of two numbers 24/7 to ""verify"" the cancellation.  It turns out the number I really needed to call to cancel the ""account"" was NOT 24/7.  However, my time being just as valuable as theirs, I informed the other Customer service department that I was verifying the cancellation as instructed: Cancel the account, and do not bill me for 6 more months.  In a couple of days, my access to the 1&1 control panel was deactivated, and I figured it that was that. Wrong.  A few days before my account was to officially expire, I received an email billing notice for the next 6 months, which would occur automatically in a few days.  This touched off a brief but intense email battle (at least someone was there responding on a Saturday!) that got me nowhere. So the following Monday, I call again, spell it out as slowly and as calmly as I could to the rep: Account closed, do not bill (too late); however, her Supervisor would reverse it (which did occur in roughly two weeks). I give the rep immense credit for dealing with me and getting the matter taken care of in one relatively short phone call.  Ironically, I still get the ""stats"" for my website via email.  I wonder how long that will haunt me!"

1&1 Internet,www.1and1.com,Aleksandr Oreshkin,"Thursday, August 18, 2011","This company is cheap because it cuts corners. For instance: their Tech Support is little more than glorified secretaries. If you have a problem don't count on them to fix it, the most they can do is read a script and tell you to wait 24-72 hours. God forbid you ever have an issue that needs fixing, they will only break it further.Secondly be prepared for major lag within your control panel.The service itself and the control panel are very well laid out, however. Their support of catch-all addresses is nice. The creation of FTP users for directories is very good as well. But the MYSQL DBs are slow as hell.In conclusion, if you are really cheap and don't even plan on relying on tech support you should consider this service. "

They scheduled a time and made sure to migrate everything and accomplished it just as promised. As a few minor issues popped up  after the migration, End Layers support team really excelled not only in amazing response and resolution times, but the amount of dedication they had to solving complex issues. Unlike many webhosting providers that stick you with a cookie cutter stack of software that you do not need, EndLayer works with you to find out exactly what you need, helps you pick the most efficient and high performance software to tackle the task, configures it for and then makes sure it keeps running!  Ive been nothing but impressed by the End Layer team, and Im looking forward to a long relationship with our new webhosting provider."

There are several tools available to me to(theoretically) correct any problems which may affect my 'viewability' thru search engines.  The problem is that these tools do not work correctly.  I have submitted 6 or 7 trouble tickets, and the latest info given me by a supervisor in the tech support dept is that this has been an ongoing issue with the software, that 'more than one account is affected', and they are working on it; that after trying to convince me that I didn't really need to use the software, and that the problems with error s in my website weren't affecting my viewabilty, even though the software itself states that!!!

CurHost, www.curhost.com,Dennis Graff,"Tuesday, May 7, 2013","I am using CurHost for multiple instances of service, for about half a year now, as well as other providers. One were overselling and one couldn't re-install a virtual server right. That is what I noticed, those two by the way were two other hosts. I never noticed a thing from CurHost, because I never had a problem, even to this day, it just runs fine 24/7. Not a single problem that far, oh wait, I've had one time where it shut down for 5min due to an update, which is still good. The offers they have sometimes, you should keep an eye out! "
CurHost, www.curhost.com,Simon Thyregod,"Saturday, February 4, 2012","CurHost is a fast and reliable host. They have their own unique control panels. One for domains, one for ssl, one for shared hosting and an easy one for servers if Linux Debian isn't your favourite OS.Overall I think they are very good. My site got faster when I changed host, and many of my visitors where commenting it! I find the Control Panel really easy to use and quick to get around.Support is great. As they promise they're there 24x7 and even though I'd not contacted them much, they've been there.I'll recommend 'em to all who asks for a webhost!"

eHost,www.ehost.net,GS,"Monday, February 8, 2016",After finding the basic program being  not user friendly I decided to go with another company I used in the past. Now we are talking days in which I had the account so you would think it would be easy to cancel. Forget it! Tried 3x via support and all they do is create a tickets. I would like my domain name released so I can move it to my other service. Put a stop with my CC company to make sure it gets canceled now.
eHost,www.ehost.net,Terry,"Monday, December 14, 2015","After signing up I was unable to post my site. They lied and stated that the problem was with paypal not paying them. I checked with paypal and my card company and found all transactions complete. The real issue, after some contemplation, I determined must have been with the proxy server I use. Ehost claims that there were ""security issues"" that had to be resolved, fearful that apparently because my IP address didn't match my other info, I was scamming them and I was automatically treated like a fraud. I decided not to remove my privacy protection, as I can use it anywhere without difficulty like Amazon and Netflix, and cancelled all services the same day. I am still jumping through hoops to get my money back. Clearly they hire imbeciles that don't understand proxy servers, and expect me to drop my drawers to do business with them. I'll pass.  The reason they have high reviews is because they lie to make any problems that occur an issue with the customer, not them. Also read the fine print, the charges more than double after the first year. These clowns are the worst in the business. Don't get fooled. You have a right to protect your computer and whats on it 100 % of the time. Pure scum."

I deal in computer peripherals and things are quite challenging for bulk orders coming my way. Quoting huge orders bring in the task of considering packaging, method of shipment, other expenses incurred added to the final quote that will be sent. This needs automation at every level when it comes to sorting of products, referring to information based on each bulk order in a day and attaching the orders to the customers. This was otherwise a long brain straining process if done manually. A good move to channelize sales towards betterment. "

I was so pleased with their level of service that I eventually went on to have them re-design our website and make it mobile ready. The process was seamless; they really took the time to understand what I wanted. I couldn't be happier with our new site.

Talkdesk,www.talkdesk.com,Michael McKenna,"Thursday, May 7, 2015","SmartCloud (www.smartcloud.ie) is an cloud services provider, we resell a portfolio of cloud based business solutions, primarily in the area of Google Apps and CRM. Internally we have integrated Talkdesk with our Nimble CRM database. This integration with its click-to-dial functionality has dramatically increased call volumes from our outbound sales team. As call dispositions in TalkDesk (and recordings of the call itself) are automatically recorded as a note against the contact record in Nimble we have a complete record of who said what to whom and when - vital for getting a 360 degree view of the customer. Integration of TalkDesk into the Nimble Gmail extension means that agents now have complete access to CRM information in their inbox plus the convenience of click-to-dial functionality in Gmail as well as in the CRM itself - a dramatic increase in convenience and productivity. Pros: We have been working with TalkDesk since they appeared in Beta, well before the product was commercially available. I have always found the TalkDesk support team to be really proactive both in implementing improvements which we suggested (like the click-to-call functionality in the Nimble extension for Gmail) as well as resolving the inevitable minor issues you get when setting up any new system for the first time.Cons: Very few cons to be honest. I would like to see a native mobile app, but other than that our experience has been very positive."

This increases substantially the volume of the help tickets my agents can handle on a daily basis."

PanTerra Networks,www.panterranetworks.com,Al Kalar,"Friday, July 11, 2014","We were clients of Pan Terra for several years. Yes, the service is good, but a bit overpriced. When we decided to change carriers, we discontinued service, using their website, half way through our paid up service period. Not only didn't they refund the unused service time, but they sucked another month's fee out of our card. Attempts to get them to refund the money they stole have been met with stonewalling, empty promises, and apathy. They know it's not worth the cost of a lawsuit, so they've kept the stolen funds."

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is still considering it!"
Oaisys,www.oaisys.com,Terry Skinner,"Tuesday, March 1, 2016","The product itself is decent.  It has a lot of features and is pretty easy to use.  But if you are a smaller company and think you'll need any support at all, I would encourage you to look elsewhere.  In order to speak with a tech, you have to have a Tech ID - which requires a class that is not free to take.  If you don't have a Tech ID, you cannot get support.  We were told that we would have 10 days to talk with the installer if issues arise but I cannot get the guy on the phone.  In essence, we've paid for a product that doesn't work as it should and we can't get them to fix it. "

CrownPeak,www.crownpeak.com,Eric,"Thursday, August 2, 2012",We used CrownPeak to evolve our content marketing channels from just the web to mobile and social media. The fact that their CMS comes integrated with mobile and social media capabilities was a huge buy-in for us. We're a small marketing team so being able to manage all of our content from a central location with minimal IT involvement is extremely helpful in rolling out new campaigns. Their CMS UI is sleek and very intuitive. 
CrownPeak,www.crownpeak.com,Terry Winslow,"Wednesday, August 1, 2012",We brought in CrownPeak to augment (and eventually replace) our existing on-premise WCM platform. We determined that a SaaS solution was ideally suited for Web Content Management.

CrownPeak,www.crownpeak.com,Liz Corring,"Tuesday, July 31, 2012",I found that CrownPeak had a unique offering in the market that allows companies to be agile and grow at a pace that is cost effective and productive for its customers.

Hostingsource,Write a review,Pablo Kuevas,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","All I can say is that, Hostingsource has been the best I have been with in the past 6 years of hosting websites with other companies and this company. Their customer service is fast and friendly. Hardly any downtime. I have several websites with this company. Excellent customer service. I can't rave enough about them"
Hostingsource,Write a review,Moises Fernandez,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","I have been very pleased with Hostingsource. Competitive prices and great service. If I have a problem or question, they respond every time. There is usually a wait of a few hours.  They treat me personally and have called me on a few ocassions as well. "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Vlad Rosca,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","I started with Hostingsource about two years ago. They were quite friendly and helpful in getting my website transferred over to them. I have had some technical question and I have always received answers promptly. Their support staff is US-based which is a help as far as I'm concerned. They always, always bend over backwards to help any way they can, and that includes in the middle of the night, when other providers put their dummies on staff.

Hostingsource,Write a review,Brian McGinn,"Wednesday, April 29, 2015","I've been using Hostingsource Hosting for more than a year, and I have no complaints. Generally you get what you pay for, and after experiencing extremely poor service from less expensive hosting services, I'm satisfied with the service Hostingsource has provided to the point where I feel like I can recommend them with confidence."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Smiley Kamffer,"Tuesday, April 28, 2015","My experience with Hostingsource has been awesome so far. I experience very little downtime, download speeds are good for the most part and I have yet to run into a serious problem where I would have to contact customer support. I also love that they add new features every month and the amount of bandwidth and disk space you are allocated grows every week. I personally would recommend this web host to anyone that is starting to get into building/running websites as their web panel is very easy to use."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Gervais Harry,"Monday, April 27, 2015",I am very happy about Hostingsource services. Space and BW is unbelievable but true. I have 5 sites on 1 account. My ste s using lots of resources because of its multimedia content. But clustured system is very fast. Their control panel is improving every month. They make the best every time. I strongly recommend you this guys.
Hostingsource,Write a review,Debra Welch,"Thursday, April 23, 2015","The main thing which i like about Hostingsource.com is that they are providing the extensive storage space in each of their package, and a wide range of domain name extensions. To start with they have a smart and easy to navigate website of their own."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Albert,"Wednesday, April 22, 2015","I first contacted Hostingsource.com support staff for help with one of their packages, I could tell this host was a keeper. Their support staff were so kind, and even transferred my existing reseller at no charge. It's too soon for me to fully rate everything having to do with Hostingsource, but I can already see great things! I have not used any of the tools provided, but they have them and that is what matters to me right now. I am excited to start learning."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Nicky Hatton,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","I have no experience in webhosting l and i thought it will be really hard.All I wanted was up and running website and adequate support.I have heard of Hostingsource.com from a friend who is really happy with their services and right before I was about to give up,I decided to give it a try. And i am happy I did. Now I have all i need and even more! They answer super fast and they really help when i need."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Alex Deas,"Thursday, April 16, 2015","I have used Hostingsource for several months, and they have a very responsive staff. I experience some slowness or downtime every so often, but they manage to resolve them within a reasonable time frame if we contact them. Overall, they are a big improvement from my last host, and I hope they continue with their good service."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Paul Marlin,"Wednesday, April 15, 2015","I have no technical knowledge therefore can not say anything about their servers, network, etc. However, I can say something about the people - the owner of the company and the members of their support team and nice gentlemen and very friendly. Hostingsource has been the perfect web hosting company for me. Very reliable and fast friendly technical support. My expectations are always exceeded. Thank you Hostingsource."
Hostingsource,Write a review,John Zantek,"Tuesday, April 14, 2015","These rare qualities are what I have experienced in my long-term relationship with them and are why I highly recommend Hostingsource for your technological needs. As a customer, I am particularly fortunate to have a reliable email and website host, as well as a support team that is available to timely answer all questions no matter how insignificant.They are very professional and have designed a user friendly website."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Elison Teanaks,"Monday, April 13, 2015","I have used many hosts over the past 10 years, but Hostingsource who I have used for the past 2  years has proven the best by far. Long term experience with managed servers has taught me that the most important thing is quality of service, particularly quality of support. It's no use having super cheap hosting if no one is there to help you when it goes wrong."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Mira Anderson,"Friday, April 10, 2015","Except for the cost, I've so far been very, very happy with Hostingsource. Setting up with them was a snap. I had my full site online and at 100% steam within 2 hours. Tech support is friendly, helpful, and accurate. I have been Hostingsource customer for many years. My site has traffic from Asia and also the US. They are very good service, excellent customer service via chat and email."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Nick Bristol,"Thursday, April 9, 2015","Hostingsource has been a wonderful host. Their support has always been responsive, they don't lock down the server to the point of uselessness (I can do quite a bit through phpshell), and the connection speeds (including ftp) are much better than my previous host. The cpu load from other users is pretty low, and even if the disks look full on cpanel they seem plenty responsive. Their goal seems to be to satisfy customers, not to make it difficult to switch hosting. I am on the php5 plan. Please email me any questions."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Mertcan Demir,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","I have two accounts with Hostingsource.com, its a nice web host because they offer a wide range of plans for each kind of users. It is well priced and within everyone's budget. They also have more advanced plans such as dedicated servers for those who want to utilize the power. Setting up my site was easy except for the help section. Overall I don't have any complaints. Their online help is great for the quick answers that you need."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Tom Kisler,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","Since they have good technicians, they handle things faster and correct, so they can handle technical issue better in less time. Probably that is reason that they can afford to offer cheaper service or they might have learned few other tricks of purchasing cheaper servers. Whatever, I dont care how they do it. What I care is good service and I am getting it. Overall service of Hostingsource is fantastic. "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Jack Thomas,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","We have experienced numerous problems with the company Hosting Source including banned IP addresses on multiple occasions, 2 different websites having files changed 3 different times causing the websites to go offline, overbillings for charges on 4 separate occasions, IPs being banned for spamming when no such spamming occurred on our end and their technical support department has repeatedly blamed these issues on our team and on security flaws in third party software we have used which has never been an issue with any other hosting companies we purchase hosting from. The company has worked to attempt to fix these issues as we made them aware, however the constant issues, support tickets, blaming our company, and more than 8000 emails sent to us when they made new security protocols too low and the heated conversation with the one of the owners named Ron was the final straw.  "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Jessica Pierce,"Friday, March 13, 2015","I could not be more pleased with Hostingsource than I am. As a former customer service manager for a large company I have no hesitation in recommending this web host to all who want a risk free, trouble free. This is a straight-forward, easy to use service company. Tech support is quick and reliable. Their prices are reasonable. I can only speak for the first 48 hours, but thus far, I'm glad I switched.I give Hostingsource 5 stars."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Lucil Alexis,"Thursday, March 12, 2015","So far they have been excellent. I've had to contact support a few times and on all occasions my questions was answered very promptly.Hope everything keeps going the same way and I do not have problems like what I've had with some other hosts.I have been with Hostingsource.com for the last 5 months and everything works really good. Recommended."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Tony Ownser,"Wednesday, March 11, 2015","I've have never had a problem with any of the sites being down (that I am aware of). Their control panel is intuitive and powerful. Hostingsource service offers me a lot of freedom when creating/modifying my sites with support for PHP, MySQL, PERL and all that good stuff. I've used their technical support via their web system a few times regarding domain name transfers and MySQL questions. They were always quick to respond (usually within 15-20 minutes) with the solutions to my issues (or my dumb questions)."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Steve Wang,"Monday, March 9, 2015","I moved all my sites to Hostingsource: great pricing, friendly user interface, excellent support and decent uptime.Support is usually great, my only complain being that the original average support response time of 14 minutes is now more like 1-2 hours. This is to be expected with the kind of growth they've experienced, however."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Tim Stadman,"Monday, March 9, 2015","I have been with many web hosting companies and Hostingsource beats them all in pricing and support. First time I checked my site sometimes, accessibility, speed. But now - there are no check need. It's only working. And one more question about support - it's really brilliant!"
Hostingsource,Write a review,Max Schneider,"Thursday, March 5, 2015","We have been with Hostingsource for almost 7 years now, and I can't remember a single minute of downtime with our website or E-mail. I can't imagine receiving better service from any webhost regardless of the price. I understand that no webhost can be perfect 100% of the time, but I have yet to see anything but perfection from this company. "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Dean McInerney,"Wednesday, March 4, 2015","It has a good amount of storage that lets me host quite large files and also has good download speeds as know from my visitors who download the hosted files on server. The good thing about Hostingsource is that it allows me to personalize or in other words edit my php.ini file which i consider an important element which we usually find in dedicated servers. But, to have this feature on a plan that looks similar to shared hosting is main advantage of Hosting Source over other hosting companies."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Lorena Steklin,"Tuesday, March 3, 2015","Long term experience with web hosting has taught me that the most important thing is quality of service, particularly quality of support. It's no use having super cheap hosting if no one is there to help you when it goes wrong. Hostingsource have the best tech and general support I have experienced and I have no hesitation in recommending them for people wishing good stable and well supported servers."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Manaf Bilal,"Monday, March 2, 2015","I had been with Hostingsource for a great long time. Support was awesome at first, especially with my shared server. When I got my dedicated server it was even better for awhile. I started to notice more and more outsourced people were handling my tickets. I didn't mind at first because stuff was getting done none the same. However it wasn't long after that it felt like the only thing I was doing was making tickets to have things fixed that their outsourced support broke in the first place. "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Tarek Nabhan,"Sunday, March 1, 2015","Not only did the Hostingsource staff offer fast response time, but they truly knew what they were doing and could assist me in solving my problems. The problems weren't easy, and my lack of experience in using a web hosting service didn't help things, but the hostingsource staff worked through it and within a short period of time they had everything running smoothly. They were also able to direct me to several well written white papers that detailed the tasks I was working with.I have dealt with many different companies, trying to solve many different problems. Hostingsource.com rates at the top of my list for a satisfying experience. "
Hostingsource,Write a review,John Zantek,"Thursday, February 26, 2015","I have been using Hostingsource.com for dedicated hosting for over 3 years now and they rock. They are a budget host, and you have to know your stuff since their service does not include helping newbies.That aside the quality of their hardware is top notch. The reliability of their network is amazing. Amazing server specs at unbeatable prices. Their entry level comes with 32Gigs of ram and enterprise level hard drives!!"
Hostingsource,Write a review,Riccardo Giovannin,"Wednesday, February 25, 2015","Since I work on a Mac, Hostingsource was an obvious choice. Their support is very friendly and they answer quickly. This company is better than that though, and their co-founder recently wrote a post outlining the issues they're having with the data center and the steps they planned to take to fix them. If they can find a more responsive way to handle credible customer service tickets, they won't ever have any complaints from me, not even when they have the occasional glitch or hiccup."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Shawn Murrey,"Tuesday, February 24, 2015","I ordered hostingsource.com Linux dedicated server and got double ram, storage and bandwidth as a special.To those who have bad things to say about this comapny can take a flying leap because support is quick and more than knowledgeable, they go out of their way with products that they have never even heard of before and they give guys with an average budget, like mine, a chance to compete with the larger companies.They always know what I'm talking about (I'm highly technical myself)."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Dominic Cherrik,"Friday, February 20, 2015","It took some research, viewing various places and participating on forums over at least a couple of months, reading various subjects, what staff of various hosts where saying etc.Once I had a more informed opinion I saw some good hosts including Hostingsource and this one I chose; their bandwidth is good. As for the support, if something goes wrong they usually respond within several hours and check to see if the problem has been fixed to your satisfaction. Uptime is good. And I have never had a problem using their control panel."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Philip Barber,"Thursday, February 19, 2015","Outstanding support!There's 5 stars to choose from, there should be 10 stars, I'm new to site building using oscommerce, so I'm forever calling support to help me out, they are always kind and easy to talk to and quickly get to the heart of my problems, you can't ask for any better, always only a few minutes and they are right there for you. Hostingsource is Rock-solid web host - highly recommend its hosting services!"
Hostingsource,Write a review,Lucas Brown,"Wednesday, February 18, 2015","Hostingsource.com is great hosting if you mention about price, performance, and features. Don't worry about your money, they have SLA.I Have been 6 month with them.

Hostingsource,Write a review,John Strike,"Tuesday, February 17, 2015","It was very hard for me to find appropriate company to transfer all my files to. I have checked many web hosting offers and the one attracted me a lot. So, I decided to sign up with Hostingsource. I contacted their sales representative and he was friendly and explained me everything in nitty-gritty details. I bought shared hosting plan and I paid with the help of paypal method of payment and everything was fine.During the time I have been dealing with them, network uptime is perfect and when I had some technical questions, their support was always ready to assist. I am thankful their skillful team for providing me with good and stable services."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Davis Smith,"Monday, February 16, 2015","If you have a web site with pictures of your puppy, Hostingsource is a good host and cheap. If you have a business site, it will also meet your demands on the most favorable terms. I like their vps hosting deals, they start from $10 per month and include lots of useful features. For the price I cannot find ANY better deal. Great product, all the features, very Joomla friendly, extras included and the service is easily available and very good.HIGHLY recommended! "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Erick Wonder,"Friday, February 13, 2015","My webmaster, whom I trust implicitly, recommended Hostingsource when I told him what type of website I wanted to create. He spoke about the reliability, the bandwidth and the support as being the most important features. Now I know why I trust him. Hostingsource is great! They have always been prompt and effectual in helping me when I have needed assistance. The price for there web hosting service is excellent."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Timothy Dalton,"Thursday, February 12, 2015","I now use Hostingsource to host every website that I build. Their asp.net lite package lets me start a new project as I iterate over my early development sprints and scale it up as the project nears completion and gains popularity. What more can I say? Low price barrier to entry and high end support, that's the whole hosting package from one provider!As a satisfied customer, I highly recommend Hostingsource."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Samuel Peter,"Wednesday, February 11, 2015","I have yet to find a host that offers such good pricing for the amount of features they offer and service they provide.Hostingsource server uptime is something that I never believe because some companies state 100% uptime. Honestly from my experience 100% uptime is impossible because they need to take the server down for software updates and that sort of stuff. I'm really enjoying known my web site is in good hands and is up when I want it to be. Best host ever! "
Hostingsource,Write a review,Enrique Dias,"Tuesday, February 10, 2015","I needed a plugin installed on SquirrelMail and it was done at my request even though normally that's not something that was supported by CPanel. Hostingsource once again goes above and beyond, excellent customer service. I found it to be good value for money and the back up has been terrific I am a novice and the online help has been marvelous.I use the space to host our church website.I've flitted from host to host in the past, but if things continue this way, I don't see myself switching again for a very long time."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Daniel Teeson,"Monday, February 9, 2015","Listen guys I don't know about reliability because I just signed up but let me share my experience with the signup process.First, Hostingsource web site is top notch. I submitted all of my information and then received an email that I would hear from a tech shortly to ""activate"" my account. They activated my account with zero problems and I was ready to go.The excellent customer service and technical skills are the best advertisement of this people!Overall, highly recommended. Let's all hope they keep it up..."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Johny Webick,"Friday, February 6, 2015","Hostignsource is really amazing! We have two servers co-located in the facilities. Any time we have any problems or any need for anything these guys get right on it. They have given us support for every problem in less than an hour and have gone so far our of their way to ensure we are satisfied with their services.It offers the best options like Microsoft SQL where you can have EXTERNAL connections (good luck finding that one somewhere else)...It is just a great host, i started using it and it has been great for me. I'd recommend it."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Jessica Fridrigson,"Thursday, February 5, 2015","I've been with Hostingsource.com for just 3 weeks. I used to run my forums on a VPS, but that was just not what I wanted. I choose them because they had very good reviews all over the internet, and whenever I visited their site, the live help was online. Great!The pricing is very good, especially for what you buy for it. Tried their support even at 3A.M. and support tech was their to solve a apache issue in a minute."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Monique Saxton,"Wednesday, February 4, 2015","Your sites with be in good hands if you choose Hostingsource - I like the work they do for my sites.Lots of features for a reasonable price, including unusual ones like clustered (redundant) servers and storage for offsite backups. No silly limits. Simple and effective anti-spam system and webmail. Mail and databases are served from separate redundant machines as well. Most hosting companies have redundant network connections and power supplies, but at Hostingsource nearly everything is redundant, which is an excellent principle."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Brandon Seltics,"Tuesday, February 3, 2015","Hostingsource.com is reliable web host. Over 4 months there was just one small downtime of 4 minutes. Support can be slow at times and setup took up some time because they marked my order as fraud.The first issue involved a spammer who was sending mail from our server using a hacked contact form we had installed for a client, and the other issue involved mod_security working a little TOO well (blocking 2 clients from viewing their admin backend in a PHP script they had setup), and both times, Hostingsource techs took one look a the problem. It was fixed. They typically don't do this kind of stuff, but they knew it would be much easier for them to fix than to try explaining to me how to fix it myself."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Patrick Singular,"Friday, January 30, 2015","HostingSource pricing seems like a relic of earlier times. I have been on them since 2013, and their uptime and service have both been spectacular. I don't know much about the features - I have support people to help me with that. It's really just the pricing that has me looking elsewhere.Servers are fast, heaps of spare processing power, database queries happen very quickly."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Andrew Dilon,"Thursday, January 29, 2015","After frustrating and unreliability experiences with other hosting services (including very large, well known hosts), I started a search a few years ago for a hosting provider that people were actually happy with. That's how I found Hostingsource. The volume of comments from happy customers led me to call them. Their team have perfected the art of great customer service. Extremely knowledgeable and very patient.I will strongly recommend them to anybody."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Timothy Dalton,"Wednesday, January 28, 2015","The customer service is outstanding, the services included is AMAZING, and the price is unbeatable. I have not had one day of trouble from this hosting account, and only contact them to help me set up issues with my domain. Very kind, easy to work with, and exceptional service and value. For the price it includes tons of feature you'd expect to pay more for elsewhere. My only gripe is that occasionally the server will be down but they get it up pretty quick. They are great! I would recommend Hostingsource to anyone who needs hosting at a great price, with all add-ons included in that price."
Hostingsource,Write a review,Nicolas Bet,"Tuesday, January 27, 2015","Move of my sites is complete. So far they are very responsive and have received no downtime notices from SiteUptime monitoring.

In fact I switched to them after I read on sites like this that they have great service...And it was true....at first. It is very easy to get a hold of them. And their support has never been better, and their server never more stable and reliable. If you still have doubts, I encourage to try a few of those hosts who are currently ranked higher. But I am sure you'll come back to Hostingsource after some shopping around. "

The chat feature enables me to clear all my queries and doubts.Their installation of Open Source Applications and support is excellent and they set standards for customer support!Their rates are really affordable and you really should take a look at them if you want to create a site or transfer from an old host!Regards,John Lieweet"

Hostingsource,Write a review,Monique Clair,"Tuesday, January 20, 2015","I've been with HostingSource for a year now after a friend of mine recommended them when I was complaining about my webhost. While they are a bit pricier than the host I was coming from, they have more than earned the extra couple of dollars a month.The service has been great, but the customer service is what sets them apart from hosting companies I've used in the past. I get a response from somebody usually within 5 minutes and they're always willing to help.Their servers, support and uptime are superb."

It was really long period of comparing different web hosting offers and after that I decided to sign up with this company.As it turns out, I have been using their services for about 4 months and I can honestly say that I have never had any downtime.

All I want to mention that I have no headache running my web sites with them, uptime has been great - the promise 99.9% uptime is correct. I can recommend hostingsource for hosting forums, blogs, personal web sites, video and audio materials. "

With most companies, you'd be lucky to get a reply that day, whereas with Hostingsource I normally hear from them within twenty minutes, and the advice is always helpful. Oh, and even the chat feature is brilliant, for once it's a real person who can actually solve problems on the other end.They also have exceptional customer service. I had no problems getting everything set up. I am very impressed by HostingSource.com service."

They work 24x7 & have great uptime. Speed connectivity is really fast from all server connections - I like it very much.They are really the most friendly host company I have ever worked with.

They are the best in the field.I highly recommend HostingSource hosting, my site is over 100,000 files, and it was a real pain to move, because my former host are a bunch of incompetent buffoons. "

Hostingsource,Write a review,Linda Caldemons,"Friday, November 28, 2014","I have been very satisfied with Hostingsource.com thus far. I have 3 domains with them and have experienced a total of about 5 minutes of downtime in over 2 years. I have had 2 customer service issues that were resolved in a matter of minutes.They provide online backups, IT services - their team is really professional. They specialize in managed hosting solutions, software development, website design, website marketing, database integration & programming, & e-commerce solutions.The web-based control panel is fairly basic but easy to use. Although if you need to transfer lots and lots of pages of your site you'll probably want to use an FTP client because there is no quick way to upload multiple pages via the web interface. Great hosting service, I highly recommend them."

Hostingsource,Write a review,Anhiel Melo Pereira,"Friday, June 6, 2014","I have been very satisfied with HostingSource thus far. They respond quickly to concerns, and provide a top notch bargain price host. They were always quick to respond (usually within 15-20 minutes) with the solutions to my issues (or my dumb questions). They are quick and very friendly.Great control panel interface, and many options. The site has only been down a very minimal time during the time I host my site with them, it loads fast and the service is really professional.They could do with a bit more space per user, but otherwise, I have been super impressed, so impressed, I now have 3-5 family members & friends using them.You can go with this Host because you will not regret it!"

Hostingsource,Write a review,Mariana Pinto,"Friday, July 19, 2013","I've been with Hostingsource for 4 months after a friend of mine recommended them when I was complaining about my webhost. I decided to contact them and ask what I'd receive exactly. Their support replied fast and found a good fit (VPS hosting solutions) for my needs. Their '50%discount' code save a good sum of money for me. All I want to say is that the service is absolutely outstanding, the techs are knowledgeable and the hardware rocks. They answered any of my requests in less then few minutes and solved each one of them as fast as possible. I was pleasantly surprised by the backup tools they provide which I did not expect at all. Their pricing is also extremely fair, especially when considering their reliability, service and support."

In addition to the great customer service, you get plenty options, plenty of space and usage and at a great value. Uptime is good, my site is always up and I am happy. The pages load fast.

ServerHub,Write a review,Daniel Shporin,"Monday, April 13, 2015","I use ServerHub for a VPS I run and their support and customer service has been nothing short of excellent.  Whether its 3pm or 3am, I get a response within 30m, and can always connect to someone on live chat if the problem is urgent.  They recently upgraded their website, which makes opening tickets, adding services, or paying much more user friendly.  And upgrading their entire network to brand spanking new Juniper switches & routers last year has definitely improved performance!"

RareServers,www.rareservers.com,Jack Fergeson,"Friday, May 22, 2015","It was not so easy for me to find reliable hosting provider to get virtual private server for my specific requirements. I came across lots of web hosts offering vps plans and only Rareservers vps hosting solutions served my demands. The advantage of being hosted with them is that I have not seen my site down since long time thanks to their VPS servers. My previous host had a limited bandwidth and storage space which restricted me in keeping my site small. This host allows me that freedom with ample of bandwidth and disk space at affordable rates.  Rareservers is a great host and I have referred many friends to them and none of us have ever experienced any problems. According to the lists I have seen they are one of the fastest growing hosting companies in the world which is most likely the reason other hosts does not like them."

Pricing is much better than my two previous hosts. I do see that some other hosts offer cheaper pricing, but they generally lack some of the features or have sketchy reviews for support. They offer in my opinion the best value for dedicated or vps servers based on that they give you daily offsite backups which most like Rareservers charge extra for, and their support almost always gets on tickets in under 20 minutes."

The staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and able to speak to me in terms that I could understand and they were more than willing on several occasions to go the extra mile to make sure that I was a happy customer.

Their server performance and support was excellent. However, currency rates and fluctuations were the problem. I was sure that I would not find another hosting service that was as good.After doing a fair amount of research, and reading these reviews, I decided to give 247-Host a try. Based on their recommendations regarding my server needs, I selected their VPS option. I ended up getting greater and faster resources than my old dedicated server at half the price I was  previously paying!Transferring my websites to 247-Host was without any major problems. When I did have minor issues, support was quick and helpful in resolving them. So far, 24-Host has met or exceeded my expectations! Server performance and support has been excellent.

For obvious reasons it pressed the panic button inside me, have to rebuild the entire website? how much time? effort ? Money ? almost cried... was in a hot mess!SO.... I thought it was a long shot, I called 247-host, the technical support who just calmed me so, so instantly, telling me I had a package with them which would allow daily backups. also he educated me on how to take own backup from Cpanel, because I had never done one!

247-Host,Write a review,Hasna,"Monday, February 23, 2015","247-host is a company with quick, fast and easy services. True value for Money as they say. Tech support - efficient - to the point - hassle fee. Pleasant change for market trends which are vague / time-consuming responses. Their support staff usually provides the information in the first few minutes without having to put me on hold and ask someone else. The staff really tries at every level to understand needs, rather than try to read a script at every turn. I recommend 247-Host to anyone looking for hosting option which is reasonably priced and good to work with."

You will not find better support anywhere."

247-Host,Write a review,Shaun McGregor,"Tuesday, October 21, 2014",I have been a customer of 247-host for a while now. I have had multiple accounts for multiple sites. They called me up after my purchases and ask if there were any questions or help needed to get my new site up and running. There user interface is easy to use and reliable even for a beginner. There are so many features that I can't even use them all on one site. The site up-time has been 100%! The billing is all explained and detailed with the billing pages. The price and features are just right for me and what I need. I have tried other hosts and 247-host is the best in my opinion. I suggest them all the time. I will always stick with 247-host!!
247-Host,Write a review,Shon A. Turner,"Friday, October 17, 2014","I have been with many different web hosts over the years and I'm voluntarily writing this review because I am really happy with 247-host. If you have a Word Press or similar site, and are looking for the most features for the lowest price, they are your solution. I only know their support technicians are great because I have had to contact them on two occasions to fix a problem that I caused. Why is that significant? I'm always a little leery when I read about how great a host's tech support is when the customer indicates how quickly the host responded to an outage. Really there shouldn't be an outage in the first place. Second should there be an outage, the customer shouldn't even need to be involved. I don't want to have to contact tech support if that were to happen. It should just simply be fixed. It seems obvious to me but unfortunately it isn't obvious to many web hosts which is why I'm happy with 247-host."

247-Host,Write a review,Maria,"Monday, June 30, 2014","People these days find it difficult to locate a good retailer for anything.  Online hiring and purchase seem scary most of the times.  I think if you want to buy a domain or anything web related within your desired preferences 247-host is  right place. These people are incomparable. Superb service and remarkable attitude toward customers and their work. Once you sign up with them  you can be care free because your domain is in the right hands and there is no tension about it. They seems to work 24 hours in shifts, as even a late night and early mornings when I had some email related issue and I called them, they were there. Important thing is server is never down, site is always up, these two opposites when combined, mean peace of mind. So I recommend that dont worry if you are planning to host your domain with these guys, you will be ok. As I am  ok there."
247-Host,Write a review,Kim,"Monday, June 30, 2014","The first time I came on the site I was quite astonished of their services. I was quite amazed by them and their DEMO services with passwords.

I am really, really amazed by these people and have never seen anything like it. I highly recommend 247-host for any one / everyone who need a decent hosting company at competitive cost."

Most basic plans are suitable for small hosting jobs like personal pages while there are packages with very high space and bandwidth allocation. 247-host in my rating for support wise it is above average. May be, the fastest and most dedicated. Feature wise its as good as any other player player on the market. it is fully featured, you have every tool you need, and everything is easy to locate and use. Cost wise, one may not be able to find lower cost than this. So overall I would rate 247-host 'good'."

I choose 247-host after few days online searching and I can say that there are not much hosting companies which can offer such prices, features and support as is being offered by 247 (I hope it remains so).

Some of my friends keep taking of poor technical support of their web hosting companies. I often wonder, how come, people get money for service which they cannot perform and how come people keep paying them. I think the role of reviews is important. 247-host is far superior company, - they solve problems and on an extremely timely manner. When I have a problem - their technicians get information which I can give them and determine what the problem is and fix it for me, while in most cases, you are in an IM session. I mostly use IM and when not available I know I can leave a support ticket - they are all over it. I can't praise this team of support folks enough - they make things look so easy, they have not had any downtime since I have been a customer, and they never talk down to you in some language you just don't understand - rather they are ""real"" people who know what customer service is all about. Thank you 247-host for making my life so much easier and for rescuing me in my times of need - I would highly recommend your services to anyone."
247-Host,Write a review,Mason,"Thursday, November 21, 2013","I had many issues with my website, till I was recommended 247-host. I contacted the company and since switching, the issues have reduced drastically. The first time I spoke to 247-host when setting up my website, I found them to be very helpful, knowledgeable and concerned to assure that my website looked and performed as needed. The pricing they offer also made a huge difference when selecting a web hosting company. The service is really good. Just tons of value. Plus, their customer service is absolutely outstanding. They've gone the extra mile for me more than once. Nothing much I can ask from my web host. Recommended."
247-Host,Write a review,Thomas,"Tuesday, October 29, 2013","The hosting service of 247-host is very fast and reliable. In business language they use a term  value for money. I can see this term in full effect when I am hosting with 247-host. 247 rocks, because, I never had downtime in my hosted sites, don't have to worry about disc space or bandwidth, fast connections and on the fly costumer support. Server stability has been exceptional and content loading very fast. My experience with 247-host has been very positive.Although pricing is affordable, and on top of it, low price here certainly doesn't reflect a reduced quality. I've used several web hosts in the past 8 years and none have come close to the professionalism and quality of service of my hosting now."
247-Host,Write a review,Alison,"Monday, October 28, 2013","WordPress hosting can turn out to be problematic if your hosting company is not experienced. I always thought windows hosting is the only hosting which can suite people who have windows installed on their PCs. So I started with my WordPress with a windows package of 247-host. I stuck with it for a while, but after discussing with support, we switched to the Linux. Things settled quick! I think word press is more suited for linux the for .net hosting.247-host have a lot of options in their web hosting packages which makes decision making easy for level needed but where I decide is by their customer service. I must say that every time I had to deal with support, they were helpful and solved my.Overall, I think 247-host is great and why I rated them high here."
247-Host,Write a review,David,"Friday, October 25, 2013","Fast, reliable, amazing web hosting services. Sometimes back I had a problem with pages getting a 404 error, the person on phone provided me with a link and I created a ticket. Within 10 minutes my pages were back online. I rarely needed support, but the few requests I had were solved in a reasonable time. Their customer support has always been helpful, their prices is great, never had issues with up-time, so everything is well in its place with 247-host. No problems in recommending them to everyone here. "

247-Host,Write a review,Jones,"Thursday, September 5, 2013","247-Host was helpful in helping me get my account set up and running. I had dealt with other hosting companies in Canada who made me feel stupid for asking questions and then refused to offer a suitable answer. After having my fears abated by the sales department I was pleased to find the technical support was just as nice, they were very helpful and I never felt degraded in dealing with them. I do not remember to have any issues related to up time or lazy customer support or any thing else in my 5 months experience with them. What amazes me is that they are surely one of the lowest cost hosting service providers in the industry."

247-Host,Write a review,Mike Ward,"Monday, June 10, 2013","I signed with these guys for VPS and it has been nothing short of a nightmare. For 2 months the server crashed on a daily basis costing my clients thousands of dollars. Support was extremely rude and were unable to fix the problems in 2 months time. After requesting credit or a free month for my 3rd month and being rudely insulted for asking, I decided to move and they just shut me down not even allowing me to retrieve my clients files and databases. I have been in business for 15 years and this is the worst hosting company I have ever had the displeasure of dealing with. I am a web designer and deal with a LOT of hosts. 0 stars in my opinion but 1 is the lowest available. Don't get taken by these guys, stay away, warning danger!!"
247-Host,Write a review,Lennon,"Tuesday, June 4, 2013","247-host.com is cheaper in comparison with other hosting companies, they look after their clients, and they are experienced companies working for many years. A company which can retain me with them for many years now (or any one customer) are unlikely to be bad. I have noticed that their support team is well equipped with the latest customer management tools and this company is using good hardware, server grade material never fails them. Cpanel they use one of the best in the world. So, they have all ends tied up. Thats how it works well for them and of course for me. Another best thing about 247-host is uptime. Infact no down time. They know the way to do a web hosting business, is to have all things done up well. Keep it up 247-host."
247-Host,Write a review,Russ,"Thursday, May 30, 2013","I started with 247-host only because they were cheapest web hosting company. I did not want to spend lot of money of my website. After spending some time with 247-host, I realize that its not right to say that only expensive companies can be good companies and one does not get good things in low cost. Majority of support issues are answered within 15 minutes by the support guys of 247-host.  The company have their own employees for server management and support stuff (means they have not outsourced these aspects to another company). They have people working in their office 24 hours, most importantly, they work on support  in such a manner which makes me feel comfortable, as find that they are as much concerned to resolve an issues am me. If someone wants to learn how to handle customers, he should deal with 247-host. Its great to see such group of motivated and efficient people. Thank you 247 host, your commitment towards my web hosting is great. So I felt obliged to respond through this review. Well Done 247."
247-Host,Write a review,Mathew,"Thursday, May 30, 2013","How to select a web hosting company? Is a very old question. In my opinion we should contact the company and their initial few responses, like, time they take to reply our email, the quality of answers of the sales and support staff, the phone support, support tickets, payment options, more options and packages, more options in type of web hosting, put all these together and it becomes a very good web hosting company. The review by me about 247-host is as much positive as is 247-host. I transferred my hosting account from my previous hosting company, move to new server was done by staff of 247-host free of cost. It fixed up every thing for me which included my email accounts, same as they were when my website was with old company. Everything was as smooth as I could think. 247-host is the BEST, helpful. I would recommend to my friends. I am hosting PHP scripts, DB, audio streaming, podcast and downloading, Perl without any issues. Good host. Recommended host. 247-host.com"
247-Host,Write a review,Parker,"Tuesday, May 28, 2013","I recommend here web hosting with 247-Host.com as I am contented with their work attitude. To me, if we get some good thing or information, it should be shared with the others who are searching for similar thing. I have noticed that most of the reviews I find on the web hosting reviews are criticism of frustrated customers about bad behaviour of the web hosting companies. When you host for more time like one year, only then you come to know all about the company and your comments are not based on one incident. I think a balanced approach in reviews may be good. I have contacted customer support of 247-Host many times and my problems were resolved in a efficient manner, things were cleared in a matter of couple of hours. Here I thank 247 for  efficient service. For readers of this post, the ones who are searching reviews about web hosting companies so that they can locate a suitable company for their websites, I suggest 247-host may be the right experience.

247-Host,Write a review,Sammy,"Wednesday, May 1, 2013","I feel the most important thing in web hosting is the uptime; while everything else can have some impact on your online business, its the downtime which hurts the most. Eye catching development of websites, its promotion, lot of visitors, chat support. My websites with 247-Host are running smooth, I have concluded that 247-Host are best company around in uptime. It seems simple to set up better hardware and earn money. 247-Host manages such a high quality hosting in Canada that I do not have to look for a change. "
247-Host,Write a review,Ricky,"Tuesday, April 30, 2013","247-Host always takes me with pleasant surprises every now and then. Every time I feel it could not be better, they come up with yet another offer, either in prices, or in services. I am always impressed due to their efficient web hosting services. I have not seen many companies which offer a choice of 2 installers i.e. Fantastico and Softacolous at the same time, option for 2 billing systems to choose one, web builder, Cpanel and windows hosting all by one Company. These things put 247-Host on top of the list of best companies in the world. I am not concerned about top or bottom of the world, for me its simple, happy going. I'll never need to look elsewhere. This company is good enough for me to continue with them forever. Affordable and efficient, if someone can put these two things together, no one can match them. "
247-Host,Write a review,Stuart,"Monday, April 29, 2013","First impression is last impression. My first impression about 247-Host was that they seem good at low cost. I still maintain it. The moment I signed up, I knew I took the right step. Everything with 247-Host has been tied up well to minor details. Speed and uptime proved that this company is seriously in business and not part time workers. As a web developer, I knew that servers are configured to take most issues of php scripts. So no hassles of calling and request for re-configurations. Simple turnkey solution to everything I needed. The staff knows user requirement well and I assume this is the main reason for 247-Host being on top. I am completely satisfied with the service of this web hosting company. Nice, comfortable people to work with."

It was all so helpful, moving the site from the old server, setting up at new server. It was quick and there on the website, it opens quickly and remains open. It was made easy just because of their great support team. They are of immense help without giving us a headache. Their control panel is very intuitive and I really enjoy the performance."

Before becoming a customer I wanted to be sure of only one thing, someone should hear me when I have trouble regarding my site. I can assure you that every support query be me was handled by 247-host on priority basis (or they managed to make me feel important to them). As a customer at 247-host one does not need to be computer expert or a web developer kind of person. Basic knowledge to express the problem in the simplest language would be fine. They are good enough to interpret problem. My experince with 247-host proved that they are suitable for all kinds of websites and customers.

Canadian Web Hosting,Write a review,Katie Meyer,"Tuesday, October 11, 2016","I've been incredibly disappointed with Canadian Web Hosting. After setting up my website last year and backing it up, I re-visited it last month to discover that the site wouldn't load at all. With no notifications from Canadian Web Hosting, my site had been infected with malware and all my backups were deleted. I paid for security add-ons for the project, which is just a standard WordPress site. The fact that Canadian Web Hosting deleted my backups means that I will likely have to rebuild the site from scratch. They haven't responded to my email queries, and I keep getting passed off to other people.I signed up for Canadian Web Hosting because of its good reviews. I'm now wondering if the other reviews are fake. Since my site was infected and my backups were deleted, I've heard from other people about similar problems with Canadian Web Hosting. I'm incredibly disappointed in the product - it's erased two years of work. "

They have high technical skill level and reply rather fast, one time only when I submitted a ticket at night response period was 1.5 hours. When they respond to a ticket you feel as if you actually got a real answer to a question. For the price, I can't complain about their performance. My experience with them so far has been above and beyond expectation, that is why I decided to post this review and give other users a chance to feel their top services. "

KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Marie,"Tuesday, March 22, 2016","I am a newbie and when I was looking for a host I wanted to find the hosting company which have a good help desk to assist me cause I have no prior knowledge of hosting a website. When I purchased a host from Kvchosting I didnt expect them to be so helpful. For that price Kvchosting can not be beaten. So far  I have not seen any downgrade in speed and I run server and speed tests monthly. They offer great free tools with any plan, even the lowest. The waiting time for ticket response is not very long (2- 15 minutes), I even get some my issues resolved instantly. Nothing is perfect in our world, especially hosting provider, but I believe Kvchosting is a reliable host, close to be perfect."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Arnold,"Wednesday, March 16, 2016","Im using their shared hosting ssd powered plan and have received nothing except quality service.

I highly recommend Kvchosting for every company where tech support is required.
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Bayridge,"Thursday, February 11, 2016","I just wanted to stop by to give a review of Kvchosting. As someone with little knowledge of cPanel prior to this, the support agent was nice enough to help me to setup my domains and websites for me. I was a little skeptical at first because it was kinda cheap. Over this last month I needed to contact support a few times, including to help me install a few things on the server I needed and to re-install the operating system with another version. Both times when I contacted their support department they responded to my tickets within an hour and solved the problems I had within that very same hour. I highly recommend their service. Overall, I am very satisfied with the service provided, have no regrets trying them out and that is why you should too!"
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,WaughBon,"Wednesday, January 27, 2016","Before choosing Kvchosting I have seen mixed reviews on them, but most of them were good. Their prices are really good.

By now I have got an uptime last year of 99.98%. In summary my experience is quite good, high performance due to ssd, competent support with short time on replies."

The stability of my servers is outstanding, monitoring tools are showing me always more than I expect. They also provide a huge variety of different features with my plan, however to be honest I have not actually used their additional features, because I prefer to do everything for myself. I have not regretted since I have decided to go with them."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Albans,"Tuesday, December 1, 2015","So far even for such a small amount of money I pay for shared hosting they respect every customer equally regardless of location and level of expertise in dealing with web hosting issues.

KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Nandom Gusen,"Tuesday, February 24, 2015","KVChosting is a very bad hosting. They remove money from my account without my authorization despite the fact that, I disabled automatic payment. And to refund me is always a problem. I have given them the transaction ID for the unauthorized payment and also, I have uploaded my bank statement. and yet, they wont want to refund me. I have also been hacked on three different occasions, I have had issues with spammers. Its not just funny. they are not worth my money. I have decided to move one of my sites(www.theburningheartfellowship.org) to hostgator, and that site has been very stable and I never had issues with hostgator. This has further exposed the weakness of kvchost. I dont recommend kvchost for anyone. I have wasted many precious years with them."

The stability of my server was great and I have never observed downtime, however there were some situations when my packets were lost.

After a half hour with Kvchosting first interaction I made my choice, they were really polite, quick and knowledgeable. The average reply is about 10 minutes via ticket system.

Also I like that there is no hidden payments with them. I am active night person so when I need to contact support is is always from 12 to 4 AM and waiting time was never more than 10 minutes, wonderful support. My overall view is relatively good.

KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,JoshuaNash,"Tuesday, November 26, 2013","After almost a year of nothing but the best, I figured it is time to post review about Kvchosting. As a consumer, I deal with a lot of providers. I have not met a single company that has consistently dealt great support every time. They usually respond to easy requests pretty quickly. This company has the best value overall, especially when you factor in service and support as part of your ""value""."

They were polite and prompt. After proper research I have decided to give them a chance, they are offering money back guarantee so I it was nothing to lose. Now I want to say what I like more in kvchosting services. Of course it is server performance. They have load balanced servers and stable network. During this year I have noticed my website was unavailable only when they had server maintenance. All needed stuff I can get from my control panel. Every time I am contacting technical staff I am receiving professional help in almost an instant time. In fact I don't even think to get service from another host than kvchosting!"
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Patricia,"Tuesday, November 12, 2013",Been using them for a year now and can say this host is providing perfect service.

Features provided with my plan were really useful for first time and control panel is user friendly. My websites are always up and never slow down. Upload/download speed is rather good. In summary I am satisfied with kvchosting services.
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Allen,"Wednesday, November 6, 2013","It was really hard to me to find a suitable hosting provider. My demands were very strict. I needed good host with low price and truly professional team. They should have enough skills to provide good uptime, updated soft and good assistance. When I have found KVChosting I thought I wouldn't stay with them for long, but I always try personally to be sure that at least I tried. First month I have lots of contacts with sales and tech support about payment issues, discounts, websites setup, script tweaks etc. All that time their support was unbeatable. After this I have made decision to stay with KVC for more and purchased year subscription with good discount. After this year I want them to be the host of my whole life, sure it was some downtime and they reply not always in couple of minutes, but we all have disadvantages, I am ok with that. "

First of all, I'd like to thank support team for making transition as smooth as silk! They do not throw in ridiculous useless features. They just offer a great place for anyone that needs high reliability. They ensure that the basics are in tact, while they make their business about more. The cost is great and their deal is honest. I had an issue with one of my domain names not being in my domains list. I opened a support ticket that morning and it was immediately escalated to the hostmaster who determined the issue and resolved it.In a sea of web hosting companies, I've found Kvchosting to be more responsive and technically smart than other hosting companies I dealt with.

KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Carmen,"Monday, September 30, 2013","My position about unlimited hosts was strong: no trust for them. Everything changed after using Kvchosting.com services. I have chosen them because of their attractive deals and good features. Their plans was perfect fit for my needs, so that was the first time I've decided to use host with unlimited plans. I was a little bit scared, but Kvchosting support assured me they have money back guarantee, so I could ask for refund anytime. Now I can say that I didn't need money back and even paid them more for quality service and high level customer care. My websites are working smoothly, no downtime or  slow loading time.

It is important for me that I can find any information on their website quickly at ease. I had to contact support at some point and I was answered within 20 minutes. Solid, and better than I would have expected for a small hosting account.  Speed seems pretty fast on my sites. Server uptime is perfect, no troubles or downtimes at all, it was two times of server maintenance, but I was warned about that about a week before. Overall service from Kvchosting is solid, support guys are helpful and all the time ready to reply to my tickets."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,AndrewNeal,"Wednesday, September 18, 2013","Support - polite, responsive. I had some troubles with e-mail delivery, but tech stuff helped me to solve it. Customer care - great. Prices - Really Cheap. Totally worth it, I even ready to move to features - nothing uncommon. cpanel softaculous already became a standard. There are also free seo tools and lots of scripts included, but I don't need to use them, maybe I'll use it in future. And after some hosts, I want to believe that I've found a my best. For now I'm completely satisfied with Kvchosting.com."

It was bit scary to use unlimited plan, but their support ensured me in their reliability so I decided to give a try. Setting up was a breeze, and they are ready to help on the thread.

I purchased their shared hosting plan for 9 month ago and yet have no troubles at all! Kvchosting were helpful from the start. I don't recall having any downtime. My website loads fast and everything is going well. Support is very helpful as well and they're very pleasing to talk to. There were occasions when the sites take 2-3 seconds to load but they usually are fixed after a few minutes. Not really a problem in my opinion. I'm going to extend the host for another year, I hope this review will help you to define if they are reliable hosting provider. It is just my opinion."

After moving, I've had virtually no troubles as far as uptime or tech support. On my initial site transfer they walked me through all the details and made sure that everything was functioning correctly. I used various tools to monitor my sites uptime and Kvchosting has done as promised. I noticed them to be unbelievably supportive and guided me through the process calmly and with a good deal of clarity. Everything's going really well now and I haven't required to use any of their support services for months"

They've helped me a lot with first questions about their services and after I got to know they are supporting cPanel I've decided to use them. The hosts I've used before ruined my mood and nothing more. Now I see that finally I've got positive experience from a web host. Support is always ready to help and fast with their replies. The main thing I like is their features, they are really useful. KVCHosting.com stability is good, I don't know if there are downtimes at all, but I haven't noticed them. Anybody who's looking for a reliable host may check them out and with the current promotion running, you couldn't get any better."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,FrOster,"Thursday, February 21, 2013","After hosting numerous websites and domains with big hosts I got out of them and moved all domains to KVCHosting. First of all I'd like to say that I have found this host with the help of reviews. The number of positive reviews attracted me and now I am sure that the reviews are trustworthy. After contacting their sales I paid a monthly fee and got my account details instantly. So while their support is fast and management very reasonable. Their technical competence at such time was questionable with no resolution and while I do not have any regrets about their services, I'd definitely like to come back on-board when their services in terms of assistance during such times is more reliable. Their servers are always available, network is fast, never noticed any downtime/low performance issues. In summary after several months I can say KVCHosting is my host and the service is perfect."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Lumine,"Friday, February 15, 2013","Now I want to share my successful experience with KVCHosting.com. I shifted to them from bad service from one of the popular hosts. The price of 1.89/month is really cool and attracted me. You can say that it is low price and you can't get good customer service, wrong statement! I know that unlimited does not exist, but I am getting enough space and bandwidth, there are no issues. My KVCHosting plan contains various useful features and is provided by professionals. They always responded fast for any support query and made sure that the problem is solved. My website is available all the time and no complaints on stability. Everything is working great and fast. Hope it will stay same forever. KVCHosting is the best choice for your success. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,JamieHyde,"Monday, February 11, 2013","I've been using KVCHosting for 3 months and just wanted to share my experience so far. The service has been nice so far with no interruptions. I've used the live chat a few times, one before I signed up and another after I signed up. I wasn't sure how to setup my name servers but they set it up instead of me. I have various features with my plan which saved me a lot of money. After some time I've submitted several tech tickets and they've replied really fast. Otherwise I haven't had any issues with the service so far but I'll be sure to post any updates."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Mogensen,"Tuesday, February 5, 2013","I want to share brief review of KVCHosting. I have chosen them because my friend recommended to use them and I have no regrets. The support is always ready to help me with solving my problems. They reply fast and are polite, they always have time for me. The monthly uptime, normally, is close to 100%, based on Pingdom monitoring at 5 minute intervals. Very good performance, despite being an inexpensive shared hosting environment. Their features are really useful, not just a big list of features which nobody will use. Certainly it is a service I can recommend as a happy customer."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Jeremy,"Wednesday, January 30, 2013","After a long search I found KVCHosting.com and started an account with them. When I signed up I asked for a migration for my site. I thought that this would take a day or two to be done. Wrong! It has been done in 20-30 minutes. The performance of my site is really awesome. I have worked with 4 web hosts before, but never had such a good performance. Never had downtime, so far. At least I didn't notice it, if there was any I have to look at the network status I suppose. I am really impressed with support. They have a chat too, but isn't online sometimes. But their support tickets system is always online! I've opened 7-8 tickets, asking this and that and all of them were answered in some minutes! One of my tickets was answered in 30 minutes and this was the most delayed answer. I am very happy with them. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Harstad,"Thursday, January 24, 2013","I am very happy to tell you that KVCHosting.com is  a reliable host. I am using their shared hosting plan with a big number of features that I don't even have time to research. I have no complaints about them. Uptime is fantastic. Speed is not a problem. I don't need anything else. Of course I should dedicate some words to tech support team. Customer Service has been stellar in response time, resolving issues and just genuine helpfulness. It is refreshing. I had to contact a couple of times on script install and settings and always they've done all work for me instead of describing how to do it personally. They have time on every client and it is really fantastic.I wish KVCHosting.com will constantly improve their skills, features and services and become the greatest host because they deserve it. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Solaris,"Friday, January 18, 2013","This review is a way to thank KVCHosting.com. I have compared tons of hosts before and there were always troubles. Some of them were slow, some of them were pricey and one had zero support. When I chose KVCHosting I thought it will be one more short experience with an average hosting provider and I already started to search for another host and waited for glitches. But I was wrong, everything is working perfect, it was a surprise for me, but now I am used to quality of this host. The price is amazing, low and fair. Stability is high, I get quality which with another host I would pay not $3 but $20. All of my tickets were replied quickly in a professional manner, average reply time is 15 minutes. My overall experience with them has been great so I do recommend them for anyone who is tired of bad hosts, downtime and non-working features. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,DinkoMaric,"Tuesday, January 15, 2013","KVCHosting.com is a good host. I am getting from them a reliable service and really useful features in plans. Technical support is relatively helpful. First impression was nice. Sales replied fast and answered all my questions polite and prompt. I have had 100% uptime and reasonable load times since migrating. FTP upload/download is sufficient and gets the work done quickly. I am not experienced so I needed help off professionals really frequently which I've got it all the time quickly. As for features I've mentioned they are totally cool. I don't have to do a search on various packages to install forum, blog or something else, I already have it on board. Obviously I will need more time to see if their service quality lasts. But for now I can name KVCHosting an awesome host with a reliable service. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,LinYao,"Wednesday, January 9, 2013","The market of web hosting is overloaded by a huge number of bad hosts. It is hard for the average person like me to find an appropriate host. I have found one which I am using already for couple of months and hope my review will help others. I am talking about KVCHosting.com. The most important thing in their server is KVCShield. It makes servers protected and fast, it seems these guys know what they are doing and are doing it right. The server I am on is stable. Load is what I'd consider good and the network seems to be very responsive. Support - this is where KVCHosting excels. I don't know if they are sleeping at all because I can contact them anytime and get response in 10-20 minutes. I had to use support a few times after the migration and found that they were very quick to reply and almost always offered a first contact resolution of the issue I was reporting. What I really liked is the number and usability of features included to my plan. I have all important and popular web hosting packages and I think that any webmaster would be satisfied. So far, after 2 months I have had no downtime. Support has been excellent, with quick response times. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,GliRoch,"Friday, December 28, 2012","I have visited lots of websites and figured out KVCHosting are offering almost the same plans for similar prices. KVCHosting is different in features which they offer and prices which are lower and much more attractive. I have decided to submit ticket and wait for response to figure out the speed of their support. It was a surprise when I received reply in 10 minutes. This was good sign for me and I have purchased K plan. Account was installed instantly and tech support helped me to setup my site, it was easy to manage with a comfortable control panel which is really user-friendly. I have submitted lots of tickets and believe me, support has always been helpful, polite and very detailed in their answers. I have had the best experience with their network and servers which have never been down and fast for all the time. In the couple of months I have been using KVCHosting I have noticed they have a strong promise of uptime, service, price and support. I am very impressed."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Skyeclipt,"Friday, December 21, 2012","I felt it necessary to share my experiences with this outstanding company. Previously I've been with several hosts, but none of them could match the quality of service, support, performance, stability and most importantly the price I demand. For me that is the most important aspect of a reliable provider. I've rarely had to wait more than 20 minutes for a ticket reply. I've submitted tickets on minor issues such as script setups etc. Hands down, great support team I've had the pleasure of working with. I can name their up-time phenomenal. I can't recall any downtime that wasn't warned. Network is also solid, no packet loss. To summarise I can tell KVCHosting is a host that cares about their customers. They are providing best service, featured plans and prices that are totally affordable. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,BrettonWoods,"Monday, December 17, 2012","I am using KVCHosting.com and 2 months have passed. I just want to thank them with my short review. It was hard to find suitable host and when I noticed KVCHosting. The price fit my monthly budget, the features were attractive and the specs was what I was looking for. I was really pleased when I found this great host. The sales team have been polite to me and responded in minutes. With my web hosting plan I have got lots of benefits: fast helpful technical support staff and excellent uptime. My site is online for all the time. I had some troubles with DNS records and the support solved it for me, that was only one time when I needed help and their team showed how professional they are. Overall I am using a quality hosting provider with zero downtime and a team of professionals. "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,PintoC,"Tuesday, December 11, 2012","I am using KVCHosting.com. I am on their budget plan and get even more than what I paid for. I want to share first impressions I have got from using them. The last two months were uneventful and nothing really happened. Everything worked fine except the issue with my ISP when I couldn't reach my account. I thought it was down, but support told me it wasn't their problem and uptime monitoring proved this fact. Upon my request the problem was solved and that was the only time when I needed to contact technical support. They replied fast and seems it is ordinary for them to answer so quickly. Service is reliable, server is fast and stable, support is professional. Hoping to stay with them as long as possible.  "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Olesen,"Thursday, November 29, 2012","I don't always post reviews, but when I do it is a good one. My first month with KVCHosting.com was great: nice support, good uptime and everything worked fine and I get what I have paid for. I get 24/7 quick support with ticket, phone or live chat and may ask any question about their plans. Even  a beginner in web hosting solutions could handle dealing with KVCHosting services, because support will do everything. My site is working blazingly fast and up all the time I have monitored it. Features delivered with my plan were really useful for user-friendliness. Today it is hard to find the right host among a big number of scam and unstable companies but I see KVCHosting as the  best choice for every webmaster who is looking for quality stable hosting."
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Concistador,"Wednesday, November 28, 2012","KVCHosting are a cool host with their great features, skilled support and cheap plans. Their support has been amazing. They are quick and very diligent. Their staff communicate well when there is a problem and have always resolved issues in an extremely quick and fair manner. For what I'm paying, I would expect 5 - 8 hour response times at best and 8x5 support. I get 24x7 support with < 1 hour response times (often <15). My website has been down only once and I was notified about this problem instantly. All in all, if you are looking for great host I suggest to use KVCHosting without any hesitation. The quality of service is amazing for the low price. "

Their staff are really skilled and personally solve all issues which helps retaining a customer. Uptime is high and although there was an issue with it, I haven't noticed. I only know about it because of an email. As I already said I am satisfied with KVCHosting, great job! "
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Takiyah Raw,"Friday, November 16, 2012","The main factors for me when choosing a host was the price, the features and the location. KVCHosting suited all of my needs so I chose them. My website is small and can't be a big problem for the servers of a professional hosting provider. Everything is working fast and loading instantly. I want to praise the work of the support team. When I contacted them the first time, they answered all my questions with calmness and a polite manner. I asked how to create mail accounts, login to mail and the differences between webmail clients. I suspect they have had those questions thousands of times. But the response was fast and prompt. For now I feel safe with KVCHosting's reliable service!"
KVCHosting,www.kvchosting.com,Renuka,"Wednesday, November 14, 2012","KVCHosting has always been responsive and the first host that satisfied me. I was drawn to them for many reasons. First of all because of features: KVCShield is cool, all the software is kept updated. There are some additional features which are unique. Secondly I couldn't find bad reviews on them, but found lots of positive. I think that the main reason is their support team. These guys really know how to manage a hosting company. Sales and tech support are excellent. I would have been like a lost puppy without their support. If I needed help they were always available. I feel safe knowing that the support is working and ready to solve my issues. I have been with KVCHosting for only a month but they have exceeded my expectations. As for me their service shows everyone how hosting should be. "

Hostripples,hostripples.com/,John Adams,"Monday, September 26, 2016","Unbelievably good!!I was initially using some of those low on price, high on promise hosting providers found from a popular auction site. However, after having lots of downtimes and slow or no service - the final nail in the coffin was when one of them fell off the face of the planet along with all my websites and emails!I began to consider going back to hosting from home - but thought about the hassle and security risks of using my own server. Maintenance used to be an almost full time job on my server.Having decided against home hosting and been a victim of unsustainable cheap hosting - I looked around the market place. I discovered hostripples.com and it seemed like the ideal solution in terms of price and service.I am now three months into my time with hostripples and all I can say is they are excellent. I have had to raise a few service requests (mainly to help me with the transition from my old provider to them) and each time I have had an amazingly prompt response and solution. I never thought I would say this about a web hosting provider - but hostripples provide a superb up time, excellent service and all at a fantastic price. The best decision I have made with regards to my tech, for a long time!I have a reseller account, with unlimited bandwidth, disk space etc...Thank you hostripples - you have restored my faith."

At least show some professionalism at the time when you are about to loose a customer that too because of dissatisfaction. you will keep delaying it and after few days you will start asking to pay next bill at the cost of making website down. it was an horrible experience and we do not want to take any legal action. keep it simple, give me backup of my data and database, we are done with you guys. Thanks -QD Team"

Some times my IP get blocked on the server if i use wrong cpanel details  and that time its very frustrating because i can't accessd my own website. But i can usderstand this is for my website security from  hackers only . But overall from last 2 years i have seen  a good quality support and server Uptime. I  am a software developer in Infosys and recommended many of my friends to use hostripples service and i am glad to see positive feedback from them also. I highly recommend you to try this service  and you will be next to write few words on them  :) .
Hostripples,hostripples.com/,Adam Jackson,"Tuesday, June 17, 2014","Yes - they're cheap but what's the point if you can't get any live support!? No telephone support at all, livechat is the free version of boldchat and that is going to email! 6 hours now since i opened a support ticket yet their site says 24/7 support! Might be okay to use to test sites but avoid for business/client sites!"

Last night i received email from hostripples regarding the feedback of my service . I will be happy to write this review for them . I am in this hosting field from last 5 years and almost used all big brands . I was with hostgator before coming to hostripples . I have used HG for almost 2 years, but  after HG was sold out i have face downtime frequently . Then one of my friend suggest me to try Hostripples . So i signup with them , But i was scared about the data i have with HG and  that moment i call Hostripples support team  for help.

Hostripples,hostripples.com/,Todd,"Tuesday, June 10, 2014","We have used 5 hosting provider in 4 years and one day we received a email with a ad saying ""best web experience with affordable prices"" and we at first laughed. We had hear this from the previous 4 hosting providers and thought it was just another B.S. email. So life went on with our usual 70% up time at best providers and lots of email and lots of issues. One day we finely got a paying client and all was good for 3 days and then the hosting provider got hacked and we were down on all 10 domains and 3 servers. So, after learning some new four letter words from our former client and 2 years of work and 2000 photos gone we took our back up and called Hostripples.That was over a year ago and they have done more to help us than any other hosting provider we have ever used. Any time we need them to help us they are there. Last year when all the wordpress sites got hit and we had issues they provided protection and a back up for us till we were able to fix our code. What provider would do that for you and not ask for money. All I can say is that they are the best of the best and the lowest price out there. With thousands of recipes and hundreds of users we feel that Hostripples is the #1 web hosting provider for the price.You do not need to take anything I say for true, but with our google app and recipe sites never down and always ready for new customers our hosting provider is key to our money. I promise you that if you use them you will be happy with the level of service and what they know how to do. As some of you know my wife and I are very popular chefs in both USA and Thailand. We needed a hosting provider that listen to our issues and would help. I can not tell you how many times we have had a issue that we caused and they have fixed it for us with out asking for and money. They are the best provider we have ever used...Thanks to Hostripples we are making money and never down again. We think they have the X-men working for them!"
Hostripples,hostripples.com/,Sharon,"Friday, May 30, 2014",While I agree with a lot of these (possibly shill reviewers) they have usually tried to resolve my issues relatively fast you really get what you pay for and in this case that is.. slow websites oversold servers and other issues such as your mails getting rejected a lot due to someone on your server using the service to send all kind of nasties and getting the entire service blacklisted on anti spam lists. In my less then a year here i had two massive issues that both ended in having to relocate to a different server which comes with its own challenges. Fast service but you get what you pay for.
Hostripples,hostripples.com/,Roy Murdock,"Wednesday, May 21, 2014","I felt compelled to write this report-(it was the very least I could do for the service and support they have just given me.) I'm a newbie in the world of web hosting and this was my first experience of pointing domains to my hostripplkes account etc. I had a problem logging into my hostripples cpanel, I tried everything and after searching the net for answers to no avail I was at my wits end and I decided to use hosripples online chat. I was a bit embarrassed at first about possibly locking myself out of my cpanel account but the chat host was more than polite, helpful and patient and didn't rush or confuse me with jargon(in fact she told me to take my time). She went through all the details, double checking my details etc and it turned out I had entered the wrong password(which she quickly fixed) but when I still couldn't get access to my cpanel and she went to the extent of taking remote access to my pc and fixing the firewalls(what ever that means..) and anything else that was preventing me from logging in. The hostripples chat host must have been on for almost an HOUR, pulled out all the stops and went the extra mile to successfully help solve my problem as well as answering the many questions I had along the way. The advice,help and education I received was worth the (already cheap) hosting fee alone ! I have 100% confidence in this company and you should too.. I couldn't thank the hostripples chat member enough-What ever they pay her its not enough !!"

Yesterday I got this email from a client whose site was moved over, which pretty much sums up the improvement in speed that my sites have been getting: ""I don't know if there is anything that can be done, but when I click on the Word Doc links they downloaded so quickly that I didn't think they were working at first. It was almost as if it was looping back to the same page but then I realized the doc files were downloaded, just very quickly. I really hate to complain that something is working too well or too quickly but is there a way to have the docs automatically display a message that the docs are being downloaded? If that's a problem, don't worry about it. Just a suggestion."" Previously, my website design clients were complaining about their sites loading slow. Customer service is also very prompt. I really appreciated that all the sites I manage were moved over so seamlessly without the headache I had anticipated!"

My server hasn't worked properly since I ordered it. They gave some cock and bull story about issues with the server and it was being upgraded. But a hosting company that can't offer 24/7 support can't be trusted. I would give zero rating if I could!

Unfortunately the site became inaccessible from time to time and their support couldn't identify and fix the problem. I couldn't identify and solve it either because I am just a regular internet user. I suppose it could be some routing problem because I am from Russia. Anyway I decided to migrate the website to another hosting provider. I tried a few companies but wasn't totally satisfied until I moved the website to Hostripples. It looks like Hostripples isn't a big hosting provider and care about every client because their support is really fast and friendly. I am totally satisfied by Hostripples.

So I purchased a dedicated server.  After paying for the server I am unable to speak to anyone on the live 24/7 chat (Closed, Offline). Support tickets go unanswered, and the phone number they have is a bogus phone account (Fast busy signal). So in closing I found out the hard way that you need to research before you purchase this one cost me $55 and I am unable to find where the recurring payment is setup in my paypal account because it does not exist, so I hope it doesn't end up costing me more, Because when I signed the agreement on their website it stated that I would be charged $30 a month.

There are many other hosting companies there who offer almost all the necessary features of linux shared hosting  at the same price which it doesn't offer.
HostBlast,www.hostblast.net,neo,"Thursday, May 22, 2014","HostBlast has consistently proven itself to be the best... for me! The web is littered with hundreds of web hosting companies all competing for your hard-earned dollars. But how the heck do you figure out which one is best for you, especially when everybody claims to be the best? Let me start then by saying this: HostBlast is the best web hosting for me. It is the best for me for four terrific reasons:It offers incredibly fast bandwidth for my personal needs.It provides exemplary customer service courtesy of well-trained, US-based agents.It offers nearly unlimited expandability for folks fortunate enough to excel.It features budget-friendly monthly fees that dont leave me feeling bankrupt. Customer Service: Another notable benefit is its dedication to customer service.Anytime you need help, all you need to do is shoot support staff members a quick email, sit back and wait for a reply. More often than not, theyll log in to your site and ameliorate the errors for you as a free courtesy  even if the error is related to programming code errors and not their web hosting services. Suffice it to say, no problem is too small for them to resolve. You can also use their Live chat to get instant help."

Last year I completed my college, and I decided to start the business. I like to design and develop websites and portals, so I started web designing company. I get business through referrals but my main concern was hosting the website with a reliable hosting provider. I played safe by getting the hosting from a well known provider but very soon I experienced the first downtime, no proper justification was given by the hosting provider. This instance repeated couple of times, I don't wanted to spoil my reputation, I decided to switch the hosting company. Finding the new hosting provider was more difficult then getting a new customer. One of my customer introduced me to MilesWeb, he was already using MilesWeb to host few of his websites. I wanted to quickly switch the hosting company, I signed up with MilesWeb. It's been few months with MilesWeb and I am very happy with their support and service.

I found them in the offers section, the price was right so I gave them a try. I have outlined the basic aspects below:Uptime & Server 10/10: Like I said, I have only been with them for 2 months so its not a substantial amount of time but my site hasnt been done in the time so thats good.Network 10/10: Seems fast and stable, but I will do another review in a few months when I have had more time on the network to give a better opinion.Support 10/10: Gave them a 10 out of 10 because they do make it up with their fast response times. I haven't submit many tickets but when I have they always got answered in under 20 minutes each time.Price 10/10: I am only paying $2/m for my hosting after using a coupon I found on them so I cant complain about that.Overall, good host it looks like. Will give a more meaningful review in a few months.."

Host4ASP.NET,host4asp.net,Alberto B.,"Monday, October 19, 2015",Host4Asp.Net sucks.I have been with them since mid August (2015) and the server is down very often. Even their server sometimes is down which means I cannot even open a ticket to complain. I've tried a few ISP in these last few years but this one is far worse than any mediocre ISP. I was convinced to switch to Host4Asp.Net cause I read good stuff. I guess it's all fake reviews.I have never seen anything like that. I cannot understand how these ISP are still in business. It's a total disgrace.If someone is happy with them it means they're lying.

Support is slow to response. No live chat. Al I had was problem and problem. They are the worst company you can think of. Now I am stuck with my domain that I can not transfer because their website wont let me reveal my unlock code. STAY AWAY guys if you don't want to get stuck with your domain.
GotoNames,gotonames.com,Chris,"Monday, July 7, 2014","Whenever they can't fix a problem they just close the support ticket without comment.

When it was limewebs, very easy, but when gotonames took over limewebs, my ftp account didn't work and when I tried to reconfigure in the customer account management pages everything had a ""permission denied"" error, except deleting the ftp account of course. The files that were supposed to be on there were taking up some of my disk space quota but were completely inaccessible. The annoying holding pages (with broken css) that covered up my files wasn't helping. Especially since the account was supposed to be free for life with limewebs, but it died with limewebs.  When I tried to contact customer service by opening a support ticket, they immediately asked for more info. A good sign showing that there is someone there to help. Unfortunately every time I tried to provide the answers, they deleted them, until they got fed up with my persistence and deleted the support ticket. Unless you are a paying customer, stay away. Even then, be prepared to fight for your right to get what you pay for; or just pay less for more elsewhere."
GotoNames,gotonames.com,MCook,"Monday, April 30, 2012","I never have an issue with customer service. They go beyond my desires! Always helpful. Stuff goes wrong at least once every three months, but only when adding new plugins. They always fix it within minutes."
GotoNames,gotonames.com,Russell,"Tuesday, February 14, 2012","The customer service is non existent.  All by E-Mail in an obtuse response manner.  You have a problem, they tell you it looks good to them.Great price for nothing.  Prior to this new bunch running things I got great customer service and was very pleased.Can't wait to migrate to a better service."
GotoNames,gotonames.com,John,"Friday, November 18, 2011","Gotonames (aka Limedomains) is nothing more than a gongshow of a company. It's run by a bunch of low-rent imbeciles who don't have the first clue about programming, much less customer service.They're rude, ineffective and unapologetic when they screw-up (which is quite often).Also, never and I mean NEVER trust a company that doesn't even offer a phone number to its customers."
Just Host,www.justhost.com,Don,"Sunday, August 24, 2014","Horrible, horrible service. These guys are in free fall. You can't even call their sales office without a mishap--your call goes right into to their rating system questionnaire so you can't even talk to a person and buy something--sure glad I'm not a shareholder. This has been going on for over a month and I've reported no less than three times. They are owned by BlueHost--despite this ""partner"" nonsense. BlueHost went for a crap years back and has never really recovered despite what their slick but deceitful ads claim. Clearly this JustHost was an attempt to improve the brand but they've bungled that too. Really, honestly. Stay away from this mess; it's not worth it. I'm on hold now with customer service--28 minutes and counting--I even had an ""escalated"" ticket for someone to get back to me in June 2014 but no one ever did except to try to up sell me. It's always a shame to watch a good company lose their way. Yet JustHost and BlueHost surely have. I can't recommend anybody. I have to start from scratch. But these dudes? Nope, never again; not at any price."

Just Host,www.justhost.com,Mile Budimir,"Monday, July 2, 2012","Middle to fair hosting package but very fragile. Certainly NOT unlimited as they claim. If you try loading up the package with more than a few domains, some picture galleries or similar then support will be in touch pretty quickly! We've found the email servers to be diabolical, 3 x miss-logins in a row and they block your routers IP address (25 email users for us) and this can only be cleared by tech support.  Limits on number of BCC's in each email plus limits to number of emails you can send per hour. I know spammers can be a problem for shared web hosts but, come on, must you crucify everyone else as a result? We had a very good first year hosting 5-6 sites with Just Hosts, but it all went downhill in years 2 & 3, so much so that we've had to move our main site else where as it was down more than it was up at one stage.  The whole backend/admin side of this operation has been revamped in the last few weeks (new data centre too. I'm hoping that things will get better. If it doesn't change for the better soon, then we'll have to remove our sites before renewing for another year."
Just Host,www.justhost.com,Carl Bennett,"Wednesday, April 11, 2012","My experience with Just Host was average. They are cheap, true, but certainly not the cheapest and certainly not the best value for money. Their servers are noticeably slower than your average website and their support is good but not great. I was with them for over a year before switching to another provider and if I compare the two I really can't recommend Just Host."

These guys are very willing to help install any applets and assist with migrations. Up time seems to be 99.95%.It's a company that I will recommend without a doubt"

Who will keep their servers down for 3 days. The most horrifying service ever. If you buy hosting from them,then you will be stuck. Stay away from them. My worst experience ever from any hosting company. This is most scariest thing ever, I will tell you the reason why. About 1 year back I have placed a negative review on a review site about photonhosting.com. When I was still their customer. They threatened me to remove the review on that site or else they will suspend my account and delete all files. I was s scared of loosing all sites, I removed the review. Now I have moved to a different server and now I am making an effort to place my experience about this company. My serious suggestion stay away."

I have been using it for a 2 years now and not once has it left me disappointed in all this time. Being honest, I have hardly come up with a situation where I needed the aid of their support team but in the rare occasions where I did need them, they were quick to respond and it always was a pleasure to contact them. Their cPanel is a highlight. It is easily understandable i.e. very user friendly and full of features ( website builder, wordpress. softaculous ). It would be a joy for beginners and bloggers, Im very sure.A high recommendation from my side to THCServers!"

In any case next month I had the same kit of options.  No downtime, fast support and lovely customer service. At the first view -  they offer ordinary services, but their approach to each client is really something outstanding.Thumbs up!"

PHP was not recent enough, I was refused ftp connection and other stuff, so I left. They (FatCow) told me to give them another chance a week ago. I went for it, got a new plan... they said they improved. My plan was not set up within one day - I still have limitations (10 MB hdd space and 0.5 GB/month bandwidth) - the offer was all unlimited. Live chat and ticket submitted about this. Two days after, another chat, they told me a ticket takes 24-48 hours to solve (already passed 48 hours). 72 hours later, nothing. I ask for cancellation: ""it will take two hours"".  I ask again for cancellation after 3 hours: ""it will take a few hours"". Almost 4 days from the beginning, my hosting is not set up, my account is not cancelled... what can one do? Not recommended! A tech guy was also a sales support representative in live chat!"

I host two of my personal websites on there and have recommended them to various other people. Although I can't comment on the technical side of things (I don't know anything about that kind of stuff, which is why H$G is perfect for me, I don't need to know!) the sites have never been down, slow or in any other way not working. The customer service is second to none, any problems with anything and I will usually get a reply and solution with an hour! "

Glad I made the switch and I've never looked back at Hostgator again."

They have a lot of add ons. One of which I used was weebly drag-and-drop, which was great. But it lacks that ""professional"" look. I ended up recently switching over to other companies. iPage puts a cap on the server memory your allowed. iPage did have great support, I really liked their 24/7 chat feature especially on the nights where I was up after midnight editing. I did have numerous issues with my website crashing while using iPage because of the whole memory allowance on the server."

I've purchased the Basic Plan on July 25, 2016 with a monthly billing to try their service. Guess what?, at exactly August 25 on the day of my due date they suspended my domains turning my 2 domains into suspended cgi page. I was about to settle my bills on the same day which was the exact due date. Without any email, ticket or what ever to notify me to do that without my knowledge. I actually made a ticket on that same they and they replied that my 2 domains are working fine. They are stupid, they just lifted the suspended page the time they were reading my ticket. My domains saved those suspended page on a cache, and all my returning customers are sending me reports that they are getting an account suspended page. I've lost customers, organic views on the past few days and until now I've been getting a random suspended page because it was saved on cache."

FastWebHost,www.fastwebhost.com,Prafulla Gang,"Friday, July 4, 2014","Fast Web Host has been selling reseller web hosting package, and incidentally FWH has a satisfactory technical support for its clients.We have been hosting with them since 2008 with billing cycle from sept - with annual contract / payment. We have been paying happily the bills received and services renewed year by year.Out of the blue - in mid of contract term, FWH sales personnel chose to terminate annual contract arbitrarily and send the annual bill from earlier dates. Upon protest, they pointed out that for their faulty billing they have under invoiced their client by more than 50%. So they claim to rectify the bill sum and seek the difference from now onwards.Upon explaining that they have taken annual payment; and if at all they want to increase the billing for next billing period - they have all the rights and customer will have reasonable time to decide, if they wish to continue. BUT they persisted with their extortion like attitude, perhaps assuming that customer can't seek migration in such a quick time frame and will end up paying money demanded. Upon being explained their illegitimate stand and protesting against such unethical behaviour - they suspended the services leaving us hanging and huge suffering including of reputation. Upon legal threatening, they decided to undo their wrong doing and unsuspend; and allow us to download our data from their server. BUT by then, damage was done. It seems, company has adopted this practice of pressurizing its customer to pay additional sum shamelessly and ruthlessly. Interestingly, they argue that many other customers have happily paid such sum, so you should also pay. We had another account with them, which was cancelled by them for resource issue. They asked us to leave, but denied us the refund due for 7/8 months of unavailed service on the pretext that we didn't claim it that time. If money is not claimed then does it become unclaimable? BUT their sales personnel have chosen this tactics to extract more money during the contract term.Any existing customer - who is also forced to pay like this must be cautious in not falling in their money extraction trap. New customers must be extremely careful, as this or worse can happen with them with such unfair and arrogant business practices.They are shameless to undo their claim, if they are told of legal consequences for their wrongful claim. can they be trusted?I must say that they have good technical support team 24/7, but how can such vendors be relied upon, who can exploit your constraints.We have decided to take up this issue in our local consumer court for damages; and request that people with such experiences must also put a claim notice in consumer courts. Consumer courts are quicker and zero cost way to deal with such crook vendors.If they want to contest any of the above claims through public board, I am willing to make all communication on their support thread public to substantiate my experience."

When I did finally get the nameservers corrected, my entire website was missing, they had lost or deleted all of the files. I have contacted 3Shost numerous times over this issue. They have been unsupportive and rude, and have tried to accuse me of not uploading my website files. My website was running on their servers for several years before this incident. They also made my email address through the website I had hosted on their servers non functional. Their technical support staff have been rude, accusatory, irresponsible and unhelpful. I would rate them a ZERO, if it were possible. This level of service is completely unacceptable. Now I have to rebuild my entire website. I will not be uploading it to 3SHost, I would like to take my money and hire a competant hosting service with appropriate customer support who will be responsible for their actions and mistakes. They have not provided me with anything I paid for, and in fact they have cost me money because now I have to rebuild my entire website."
Host Hoot,www.HostHoot.com,Aries Vincent Dajay,"Friday, May 8, 2015","I've been hosting with Host Hoot with my business website since last week now. And I'm really satisfied for their business. My business TechDebit (formerly Repoda which is on my LinkedIn Account) is an online platform for advertising which I host with HOSTHOOT! And their service really satisfied me and exceeded my expectations. I can say WOOT! For only $1.99 per month with no price change meaning just only $1.99 per month if its monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, annually, biennially, triennially that's why it got my attention! And since I'm starting a business, I need a budget hosting (this is not dirty or cheap like other hosting). And about the customer support, I got wow because I've got my reply 30 minutes or more and sometimes 1 hour or couple of hours more. They are very professional because they provide informative and helpful support which really fixed your problems about your web hosting! That's all of my review! Remember, I'm not affiliated or paid by HostHoot to publicly share this review but an information about the hosting if its reliable. I wouldn't rate any product without my experience or it doesn't exceed my expectations. Thank you & God Bless!"
Host Hoot,www.HostHoot.com,Cari Jackson,"Tuesday, December 2, 2014","I'm sorry for interrupting your regularly scheduled program but I have to give a shout out to my AWESOME Web Hosting service provider.  If you own a website (or plan to host a blog) and want genuinely affordable service with EXCELLENT & OUTSTANDING  Support & Customer Service, then check out HostHoot.com.  These guys are IT Wizards. I have been building websites and social media pages for over 10 years.  I have tried numerous providers, including word of mouth referrals but I have always left the Hosting Provider for one reason or another.  Then one day while searching for a new Hosting service, I found Host Hoot by happenstance.  These guys have gone ABOVE & BEYOND since the very beginning to help me not only setup my web hosting, but they even assisted me with some of my website files, and I've NEVER had another provider who's willing to do that.  I can honestly say that Host Hoot & their leadership team should be recognized for actually putting their customers first, what a novel idea, right?!?!  I love Host Hoot and although I rarely write reviews I felt as though they deserve it and I also wanted to help someone else out who was in a ""Web Hosting Rut"" like I was!   If you're looking for a new hosting provider or if you want to find a better service provider then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you check out Host Hoot & talk to them about their amazing web hosting service!"
Host Hoot,www.HostHoot.com,Anna Johnson,"Tuesday, April 15, 2014","I have been with Host Hoot for about 6 months now and I have to say that I have been thouroughly impressed with everything from their pricing to their tech support! I had a couple technical questions during the transfer process and their Help Desk is very responsive, especially Gordon, he's very helpful. I have to say the best part of Host Hoot is their pricing, when I first saw $1.99 per month I thought to myself that I would probably have to sign up for 3 years to get that pricing but to my surprise I only had to sign up for 1 month which is amazing. This is the third web hosting provider that I've worked with and I can honestly say that they're the best. I will never leave them as long as they keep up the excellent support. I would highly recommend them to anyone who's looking for a quality web hosting provider who has great pricing and excellent support. Without hesitation, based on my experience, I give Host Hoot 5 Stars!"

As a result of this and reviews from other sites on the internet I decided to use Web Hosting Buzz for my hosting requirements.The account was provisioned within minutes and confirmation details sent through with links to useful getting started articles.  Once I set up my website I encountered a couple of issues (all my own doing!) and the Web Hosting Buzz support team were able to provide solutions within a matter of minutes.Page load speeds are significantly quicker than other hosting providers I have used and there have been no instances of downtime in the month since I started using them.Overall, I would rate the staff, package and service very highly and would not hesitate to recommend Web Hosting Buzz to others."

Set up was straight forward, he helped us choose a package which wasn't the most expensive but most suitable, so already off to a good start. As advised we submitted our Cpanel login details after sign up and they transferred our site and emails across. We then got an email that we could update our name servers. I had no idea what these were so called again and it was done for me. Site appears to be running faster. I ran there antivirus tool and found a couple of viruses in my email which I was told were sent while on our old host. These were quarantined/deleted and we were shown how to set up spam assassin to help prevent these types of email in the future. Very happy with service so far"

Media Fortress ,Write a review,Michael Stillman,"Tuesday, March 1, 2016","Having a reliable web hosting provider is imperative to having a successful online business in 2016. I have used many web hosting companies over the past 10 years, some terrible and some very average to say the least. When looking for a new host for my website I wanted a few things.  1. Reliable service. If the website is down all the time and I am on the road (with my job) then my customers and potential customers can't find our location or contact number. 2. Good technical support. I am by no means a novice but things can and do go wrong. What is important is being able to get support when I need it. 3. A partner to my business needs. I wanted a company that could also help with web design needs when they came up. 4. Finding someone local who didn't understand my needs because they are on the other side of the planet.  I have recommended Media Fortress to a few of my associates, all happy with results. "

Talkroute,www.talkroute.com,Nick Hormuth,"Monday, October 26, 2015","As someone who owns a business where customer support and satisfaction are the top priorities, it clear know when you deal with companies with top notch service and a top quality product .  For us, Talkroute failed to meet our expectations as a platform and had terrible support.  Despite their polished website, which caught our eye and led us to signup, their backend platform is outdated and lags behind some of their competition when it comes to usability, robustness, and nice features like desktop and mobile apps that simply integrating a business phone system into your small business life.  The worst part was that when things went amiss we encountered arrogant and unhelpful support, not once but from 3 different people on 3 separate support tickets.   I've never dealt with a company, especially a tech-focused company, that had such abysmal support or seemed to care less about keeping our business. Here were our main issues:  1) Slow turnaround of incoming calls - it took around 15 seconds of idle ringing and navigating a talkroutes menu before we could connect with incoming calls.  2) We had one talkroute number, our primary business line ported from Google Voice, which we added to the system.  Simple enough.  However, after a couple of days of no phone ringing we knew something was off.  We literally lost hundreds of dollars of business!  Because we had not ""selected"" our only phone number in Talkroute, which should have been selected by default it just stopped routing calls to our phone.  Upon calling customer support to see what was up and being told of the issue I was floored.  No remorse or empathy and no admitting a flaw in their system.  Worse,  they wouldn't make it right and wouldn't credit my account for any lost days, which would be more than reasonable. 3) Leading to the next point-- The talkroute system for call notification is just dated as evidenced above.  To see a call log, missed calls, or access messages you have to log on to their website.  They offer no mobile apps or desktop solutions that notify of incoming calls (say if you lose cell reception or have a spotty connection) or allow you to place outbound calls.  Placing an outbound call is a pain since you have to dial your business number and then enter the phone number you wish to call (you can't access call history for missed calls, a phonebook, etc etc).  This is just archaic.  Not a logical system and the design of their web interface is just horrible.   In short talkroute needs to step it up across the board.  They made us run away from their service and never look back.    After a through research process I found several viable alternatives that do everything Talkroute does and more, for less money!  One of the best recent business decisions we've made..."

Apptix,www.apptix.com,JohnG,"Monday, October 17, 2011","We used to be customers of Mi8 which was acquired by Apptix (also the owner of Mailstreet). After having been a customer of Mi8 for over 8 years, we have had nothing but trouble with Apptix/Mailstreet: 1. We have constant interruptions of our service. We have at least issues every single month with activesync not working, the exchange server not working, or something like it. CONSTANTLY THE SERVICE IS NOT WORKING! 2. Apptix will sell you more service than they can actually provide. We have one very heavy exchange user with multiple folders and thousands of items in his mailbox. Although Apptix gladly charges you for multiple GB of space for mailboxes, they cannot actually provide that service! THEY CHARGE FOR SERVICE THAT THEY CANNOT OR WILL NOT PROVIDE! And when we asked for a discount in pricing, since they are clearly charging us for service that they are unable or unwilling to provide, customer service gets rude, which brings me to my next point... 3. Customer service is just rude. They will not help you with issues and the standard answer seems to be that nothing seems to be wrong on their end and that they will get back to you, which happens hours later when they admit that there was some issue on their server. 4. Pricing. Apptix is just plain more expensive than any other exchange provider. They have hidden fees and charges for everything and customer service will attempt to charge you for technical support, even if the issue is on their side! And forget about ever getting a discount, if you complain about interruptions to service. We would gladly pay their higher prices if it meant that our emails ""just worked"" without anybody having to worry about or troubleshoot it.  Verdict: STAY AWAY!"

Trivalent Group,www.trivalentgroup.com,Roger Smith,"Friday, September 2, 2016","I worked with Trivalent Group employees for about 4 months. I was hired at my company to clean up a Mess Trivalent created. During my stay at my company, I was not satisfied with Trivalent past or present performance.  The actions they took against my company to prevent them from being an independent network were atrocious. When I started at my company, the network was an atrocity.  My companys data storage was under spaced by almost 30TB, Space issues a constant battle, and Trivalent set up manual server farm that was a constant resource hog.  At times this farm came to a screeching halt because of lack of Processor and memory resources. Trivalent provided no practical means of managing this farm. Viruses and Malware were common and daily outages and failures were common. It seemed to me Trivalent Group was holding my company hostage, charging high fees for service.  I was clear to me Trivalent was thwarting every attempt, Bandit took to become and independent network. In review of an audit by a third party (the audit was done prior to my starting at my company), almost 30 pages of things were discovered to be wrong. I was astounded, that this much could be found wring on a network what was supposed to be managed by a Professional IT partner. The audit was high level non-penetrating, the audit company should not have found near as much. The following are other issues I learned- In less than a year, my company experienced five massive virus outbreaks. The last to cause a massive data and production loss from ransom ware- I learned Trivalent failed to put in appropriate measure to protect against viruses such as ransom ware- Trivalent failed to put in measure to moderately protect my companys network from malware.- With Ten years of servicing my company, Trivalent built up a lot of historical data for them. Trivalent failed to provide this information when requested. I view this purposely holding information to cause my company to fail. - Refused to work with my company to become an independent network.-Failed to properly fit my company with local storage- Trivalent turned off volume shadow copy to save server space. This caused data loss when backups failed, and users needed to perform revision data restores- In many situations, Trivalent failed to demonstrate expertise when designing and implementing solutions for my company. In all fairness, a couple of Trivalent employees demonstrated decent skills for the job they were in. I do not blame the production employees. I do hold responsible, Trivalent Managers, Sales and Design Engineers."

There is just no way to compare the affordability, the reliability, and the outstanding support they provide with anyone else I have ever come across.

Cloud Web,www.cloudweb.com,Graham B,"Monday, April 14, 2014","So, where do you begin? I started out hosting my own websites ""back in the day"", mid nineties I think. At the time it was quite difficult to get a small hosting package with Shell or Root access so I went with one of the new Startups. Because this Startup company was supported by like minded people it grew and flourished to become a ""Big Internet Hosting Provider"" and that is when it all started to go wrong. I became a number and not a customer. Then followed the Disaster Years where I ricocheted from one disastrous hosting company to another. Same tired old story, incompetent Tech support, Crap servers and arrogant billing departments.One day, someone decided that I had been tortured enough and felt pity for me. ""Cloud Web"" they whispered, go sign up with Cloud Web.So I did. And I have never looked back. Hell will freeze over before I move elsewhere. No amount of inducement will get me to move. I get 24/7 support, people who know who I am and treat me like a customer. If you want cheap and cheerful perhaps you would be better served elsewhere.If you want Tech Support who actually know what they are doing, really fast servers, a pricing plan you can actually understand and above all - Reliability. There is nowhere else to go in my opinion.A first class company with one of the loveliest people in the world in the Billing department.Terrific."

Eventually I changed my web host to Host1plus. That so far is the luckiest decision I have ever made. Not only they are affordable they also offers best features and plenty of resources. I was unable to add multimedia items to my domain until I joined with Host1plus due to lack of resources.But Host1plus gives me unlimited bandwidth and disk space. Which enables me to upload anything I want including multimedia. The uploading and downloading speed is awesome too. With all these new servers they have added lately the speed of data transferring never goes down even in the rush hour. The uptime, control panel, security and 24/7 live support are other best features I found from Host1plus system. With all these awesome features Host1plus easily becomes the top service provider in the web hosting category. I recommend these guys with highest regards. There is nothing to worry as long as you are with Host1plus."

Datasoft Networks,Write a review,Maciej Kaszynski,"Tuesday, August 18, 2015",Price is good - this is true. Problem is in support. It is looks like supports engineers have performance counting how many answers they did no matter with sense or not. I have ticket open from 2 day is still open. They constantly com in put one sentence and go. When you replay after long time again try to look on a case but not read full story just give answer on last event. In this way up to now I have one serious intervention - successfully. Possibly next time when somebody try to do something will be in next 2 day. I am not saying is no good company but organisation of support in a bit complicated case is poor and make horrible imprest . Also they can call you to give access but is no word what they exactly want what device should be use. Communication skills of support is on level 0.

After dealing with many hosts in different countries I would say that right now they are the best experience I have had and continue to be so. There's been a couple of difficult times with a major Plesk upgrade catastrophe and some issues escaping Plesk to cPanel migration and every time there's been a big deal, these guys have worked tirelessly and with pleasant and effective customer service and technical expertise to resolve it. Occasionally a ticket might get forgotten a few hours, but in a 24x7 environment that's the most I can fault them for.Highest recommendation!"

Datasoft Networks,Write a review,Arjun Rampal,"Monday, July 28, 2014",I have been using multiple server from Datasoft since 2011.  They do support me 24x7 for every issue I faced. In fact I learned so much from them. I recommended Datasoft for my friends and they are also happy with the service.  We shouldn't blame a company which have good servers and support. 
Datasoft Networks,Write a review,Syed Bilal Masaud,"Tuesday, May 27, 2014","I have purchased one of their most expensive servers but still server is not good , crashed up very frequently , I have done similar setups before , I never faced any problem. In addition to that the worse thing is their support , they have people who dont know how to answer their clients , if your server is down , they will work on same flow as they do .. which really affects your customer. Never go for datasoft , go for OVH (its the best in the world) spend once but you will have peace of mind instead of your server is going down again and again. "

Simon has been very helpful in the past and Daniel B. helped me today via chat help and stuck with me for about 75 minutes until we got done what we had to (and fixed everything along the way). We even made plans to climb mount Everest together (well, sorta). Very personable customer service reps there and a pleasure to deal with, truly. Highly recommended!! Never had better service in my life!!!"

Atlantic.Net,Write a review,George,"Monday, July 1, 2013","Atlantic.Net used to provide good service, but they just ""upgraded"" their site, and in doing so destroyed my email service. I cannot log on to my account, and their tech service folks are unable to help. They just give me directions which do not in fact work. Then they say they will ""check into the problem"" and call me back, but they never call back. This is catastrophic for me, because I am a consultant, and my Atlantic.Net email address is advertised world-wide. I guess I have to start over with a new provider. What an incompetent performance!"

The first low-price high-quality of service company - bar none! Strangely they use COLOCROSSING and I thought that was the problem with performance on two other providers (also re-seller of COLO) - obviously not so.  My ""little"" 2GB low price server has been running nicely for the last 4 moths I will buy more of them for my customers ...  "

The communication through support is terrible, I ask a question and they ignore half of it, I state something in a support ticket, and they ignore it. There new control panel is also crap, they no longer have restart buttons in the panel - you have to download a file and run it, which I can't due to Java issues.Overall this company has gone downhill in my opinion, I do not recommend them again."

Rackspace email hosting is great. We've currently got 7 mailboxes at $2/month each, and plan to use Rackspace for any future email hosting needs. The webmail interface is good (not as good as others but still good enough for a quick access here and there). But where the Rackspace email really excels is the IMAP/SMTP works very quickly and reliably. Took two days to provision in the system, but supposedly that was a one-time issue caused by website maintenance and several different factors. Not a major problem, and since being deployed the email hosting is great. "

SparkNode,www.sparknode.com/,David W,"Wednesday, November 21, 2012","We are a regional telecommunications provider. This is important because 1/2% packet loss or more than 2 seconds of downtime is enough for us to terminate our account. All of our traffic must be received, processed and routed onto its destination with no more than 1/10th of a second delay. This must happen 24/7 365 days a year without interruption. At the moment we have 4 VPS servers and 2 cloud VMs which we have been testing for about 45 days now. About 2 weeks after firing up our first cloud VM we were notified by our monitoring tool that we were suffering 1% packet loss. A couple of emails and a few minutes later the VM was moved to another Hypervisor with only a few seconds downtime. There have been other minor glitches (bandwidth utilization was in GB insead of TB) and the usage graphs don't always display properly in all browsers. Short of these minor hiccups we have had 99% uptime and perfect connectivity. We are impressed with their live chat sales team and amazingly fast email support. I should note that we are technical in nature. We only rate Sparknode (and by extension Hivelocity) based on their ability to get data in and get data out without any delays. For this we are impressed. "
SparkNode,www.sparknode.com/,Cassidy Chan,"Friday, November 16, 2012","It's still an incomplete product. Some of the features have not been fully completed, like the usage graphs built into the control panel. When I first registered and had my server, we were already sent to one that was at its limits/oversold. We were not able to scale, even though the cloud is not supposed to have those problems. My site was down for a total of 1.5 days after migration because of the inability to scale. We also had many problems with our backups that are configured on the CloudVM. Our backups that were supposedly on there, were in fact corrupted and unusable. Which for about a 2.5 month period is quite a lot of downtime and problems considering they advertise 100% uptime. Their techs are sometimes incompetent/unhelpful and just say that they are looking into it or they've escalated it to their development team. I waited a week for some replies that their development team was supposedly looking at. I haven't had any major problems since then."

Ximbo,asia.ximbo.com,J,"Monday, October 6, 2014","I don't even want to put a star for this company, but it's mandatory to put at least a star. I have been using them for almost half a year now, and everything seems to be working fine. But if you ever needed tech support after working hours or during the weekend, then good luck! I even message their Whatsapp number and I saw their number was online when I messaged them, but no one responded. My server is down on a Saturday and it doesn't look like they can help at all. If your site is crucial to your business, try finding a hosting company who could help on the weekend, not just during business hours on weekdays. This is the first hosting I ever used that does not work on the weekend."
Ximbo,asia.ximbo.com,Anson,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","Can't agree more with J.  Servers are fine, networks is fast.  BUT when something goes wrong tech support is awful.The tech support does not seem to know any tech, response is very slow.  My server was down, it took over 24 hours to resolve.  I kept asking them what the problem is and it took like 10 emails over 2 days before I was told it is a hard disk problem.  They simply won't tell me what was wrong!  Weekend support was atrocious - even when the server is down and totally offline!  You get lots of prompt reply saying that they are investigating and lots of ""Thank you"" emails with no resolution.  The more you communicate with them the more you get the feeling there's really no technical expertise there.  Technical Support Hotline?  not so hot - try calling after 7pm.I would use them for staging servers because of value for money, but for anything in commercial production?  No way, no way."

If you want to speak with a supervisor they say you would not be able to reach them. If you need to upgrade a VPS or Cloud Server they say you cannot upgrade but before when you purchase the package they say ""yes"" you can upgrade. But their form of upgrade means re-purchasing another package. Their 24 hrs support is not 24 hrs support. I placed a call at 3am in the morning they responded at 3pm in the afternoon. They charge you a late fee for cancelling a server? Overall Pachosting is a scamming company stay away!"

RushFiles,www.rushfiles.com,Mads Rasmussen,"Tuesday, January 5, 2016","Been using the RushFiles product since September, where our IT advisor recommended it for our small company. The offline work mode, with auto sync, is truly amazing, and the fact that we have complete control of our data (including knowing where it is physically stored) means the world, with all the data loss/theft happening these days.The bad reviews are not representative of the product's capabilities nor it's performance, at least not from our point of view . I would personally recommend RushFiles to anyone that cares about secure file sharing."

RushFiles,www.rushfiles.com,Kees,"Tuesday, December 1, 2015","It only syncs local folders with the cloud that reside on a Mac virtual disc share. Without any notice you can lose all your data on it, as I did. No help desk is going to help you to get your data back. Instead of securing your data, its makes it lost. Thus Rushfiles is a very unsafe tool, to place your data on. "
Bitcasa,www.bitcasa.com,Theis Poulsen,"Friday, October 24, 2014","Lame company that raises the price with more than 12 times and at the same time lowering the service for the new high price. Not trust worthy, not recommended, STAY far away."
Bitcasa,www.bitcasa.com,Richard,"Wednesday, July 9, 2014",Nice system looking to look and feel like a local disk first and foremost. Uses local disk for caching and for pre-transfer encryption.

Golden Frog,www.goldenfrog.com,kyle,"Monday, October 5, 2015","I've been using strong vpn for years. When I have a problem, they take over the my pc and fix it. That's what I pay for. I tried this service cause it claims ""to be the best and fastest"" - I haven't see it.  Cause i'm In China, none of the usual rules apply with VPN and internet service cause you're literally battling against the IT infrastructure of the entire government!  Well, GF doesn't seem to provide much for help. When I have a question about set up with GF, I get directed to a FAQ page and left to read someone's book report in hopes I figure out what I need there. it feels like the customer service reps are staring at the timer trying to get me out the door in under 30 seconds regardless of whether I've gotten my problem fixed. In 24 hours, I don't know if I ever ""configured"" the service correctly, but I tried chameleon on several different servers- what GF suggested for China - and was slammed with d/c after barely 10 minutes of connectivity. I tried it on several different servers and it's just one big disappointment after another.  Right now I cant even watch Netflix on my other VPN provider, but at least I can Google - that's more than I've gotten from GF. So no, this service is sure as hell not for me - and perhaps not for anyone in China for that matter.  "
Tresorit,www.tresorit.com,Ehab Deddeb,"Wednesday, April 27, 2016","This might be the best ever cloud service in the world but their customer service & billing practices are horrible. I joined this service on April 19th, 2016 through a voucher I received from KASPERSKY for a FREE 100GB of cloud storage, expiration date of the voucher is August 2016.  upon registering my account, my credit card on file was billed 100 Euro on the same day, although it was stated on the site that my credit card will not be charged. I have communicated my issue to their customer service through  email, I submitted a copy of the voucher as well as the activation code, yet they failed to resolve my issue. then on April 26th they charged my credit card again for the same transaction. They have no phone number listed on the site for escalation, no one to talk to, they are hiding in the cloud filing their bank account with money that they wrongfully collecting. So, think twice before you volunteer your credit card information on their site."

There prices are excellent really cheap but powerful vps's at current i have 2 vps's from them and havent really had any serious problems with them.i recommend you try them out i would advise to try out there $5 plans first as they dont provide refunds on vps plans so its no loss if it doesnt work out. If you know what yur doing with vps's then this company is fine if not look for a managed vps provider. kudos to virpus though they have been there when i have needed them :)  Keep up thegod work.

eApps,www.eApps.com,Mikhail Gavryuchkov,"Wednesday, February 17, 2016","I've been with eApps for more than 10 years, since November 2005. First it was a VPS for a long time and several months ago I decided to go to the cloud and first, not knowing about eApps' Jelastic new cloud, tried another, very well known, a standard de-facto cloud. It wasn't so bad but still not error-free. And surprisingly expensive. My IT budget was draining really fast and I decided to try what's this new eApps' cloud is. And almost immediately fell in love with their Jelastic environment, migrated fully to their infrastructure and now paying only a fraction of the other cloud solution.  I've been on eApps' Jelastic for several months now. Did I mention I love Jelastic? What's more I love eApps' personable approach to their clients. Their tech support not only reply to my questions and help with setting up nginx cache, redirect rules, etc. Their tech support representative spent lots of time optimizing my app servers' memory allocation, as well as MySQL optimization, saving me hundreds of dollars per month. I feel myself in good hands. It is true you can find cheaper Jelastic providers but my years long experience with eApps' keeps me with them."

eApps,www.eApps.com,J Gomer Gonzalez,"Wednesday, March 11, 2015","I discovered eApps back in 2008 when I was looking for a web hosting company with support for Java applications. Astonishingly, there were just a few at that time. I chose eApps because they allowed direct access to virtual servers and had customer support, things the other options didn't offer.  After paying my first order I could notice that every feature listed in their offering was present and worked according to the terms publicized in their website.  That was a pretty good start... I don't like surprises much!.Every time I've had questions they seem to be pleased to hear from me as if my needs were theirs, even in periods when not being an active customer I've had prompt replies from the sales and tech staff.Beyond a clear and rich offering of services, high quality level, and unbeatable kind support, what I have liked more is their commitment to keep pace with the latest IT trends and that they inform people about that.  Take a look at the create-a-cloud service, it's amazing!"

eApps,www.eApps.com,Tyler Johnson,"Tuesday, November 19, 2013","Let's start with server uptime. When is the server down? Better question, when is the server up!? My server/sites are going down literally 20 times a day! I, of course, contact their customer service, which takes several days to respond, and am told that IT'S MY FAULT. I'm told that I don't have enough CPUs and memory to support my site! Ummm...I transferred from DreamHost and used the exact same settings. Never had any issues over there. So, I do the smart thing and ask them, ""What service upgrades do you recommend so that my site stays up?"" I take their exact specifications, update my services and guess what!? NOTHING CHANGES. The site is still constantly down 20 times a day. So, I contact them again. Once again, wait for it, IT'S MY FAULT. I ask how it's my fault and they literally respond, ""You need to upgrade your services."" I respond and tell them that I just did, following their specifications! I get a response, ""Well, you need to update them again."" I haven't added anything. The size of my site has not increased. So, obviously, I decline to do that. So then, they offer to monitor my site and re-up it any time it goes down, but they want me to pay them $10 a month to do so! Ummmm...how about you fix your servers so that you don't have to do that! They won't do that. So, I'm currently paying them an extra $10 a month to monitor my site while I find a new host! And they usually take a long time to re-up my site when it goes down, so my site is down 20-30 minutes every day, 20 times a day! That's a 3rd of the day that my site is down! Don't trust these people and most certainly don't give them business! "

Not to mention, of course, with an excellent quality of the servers.

We have had issues with Cloud 9 printing since September 2015.  They have had tremendous staff issues and client issues.  They have not been able to correct our issues but have continued to charge us.  They have lost crucial data that they did not properly backup and store which has cost us thousands of dollars.  For a cloud service that is supposed to be responsive and responsible -- the whole experience has been horrible.  They are in California -- so if you are on the east coast they have no help in the mornings for our time zone.  DO NOT USE THEM!!!

I work from home as a solo practitioner. When I decided to hire the services of a part time contractor, it made financial sense for me to have my files hosted and work remotely instead of renting an office space or having her come to my house. Cloud 9 has allowed me to scale my business affordably.  Service hold times have been frustrating at times, but they are always able to resolve my issues.

The wait to have a technologist answer my call is ridiculous.  I just gave up on this call after 25 minutes of hold time.  If you cannot afford to waste billable time, do not select Cloud9 as your hosting provider.   "
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Patrick Howdeshell,"Monday, June 8, 2015",Started great a year ago. This year it has been more head ache then wonderful. Wait times are huge for tech support. They never seem to give you a straight answer. The service always seems worse at the end of a month when critical financials are due to clients. Beware
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Jean Clappe-Mixell,"Tuesday, May 5, 2015","We have a love/hate relationship with our Cloud9 service.  It's good when it works but we've experienced so many issues this 2nd year of service. There are only 2 users in our group and every time an issue is resolved for one it goes bad for the other. I literally lost a average of 3 hours of work a week for over a month dealing with tech support issues (latency, no-launch, printing, etc) and by the way, not all reps are created equal.  The wait times exceeded 45 min.  Now, I still have to use work arounds to set my printer so reports and checks print correctly.  I've ruined so many checks that print like its an envelope.  Not sure if we will renew our plan at the end of the year.  I feel like we're overpaying for the quality."
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Jan Haugo,"Thursday, March 26, 2015","I am a cloud accountant that has used other services for my hosting of my client files. I was nervous adding a particular customer to the cloud with my ""other"" service as the other cloud hosting had poor customer support and a non-friendly user interface.I chose Cloud9 for the friendly interface and incredible customer service. The client I moved over has now been with Cloud9 2 years. The customer service is incredible. If we need anything we submit a ticket and it gets taken care of. If I need a faster response I call in and can usually get any one of their fantastic Customer Support Techs to help. Cloud9 has gone above and beyond in helping us with data file issues. These are not Cloud9 issues but their Techs help us understand the issues and solve them.You can't beat solid gold Customer Service. With Cloud9 our technology and cloud hosting experience has been stellar."
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Kirsten D.,"Wednesday, February 11, 2015","Cloud 9 has been a very expensive and disappointing decision.  At first, their tech support did a good job resolving issues but now the hold times can be in excess of 45 minutes.   And, because of the way they set up QuickBooks in their system, there are a lot of latency issues.  The system is just hands down inefficient.  They told us it was because we were using too much RAM and said we had to pay the rest of the year's contract in additional RAM upfront.  That didn't even make a difference.  We are still plagued with latency issues.  QuickBooks said the way they set up QuickBooks is inefficient and causing the latency issues.  Since they made us pay for a year in advance, we are stuck with really bad latency issues and bad technical support but bailing and writing off the loss may be our best bet. As far as technical support, I have called in and been the 2nd caller for over 35 minutes.  Then, for another 10-15 minutes as the first caller in line before I gave up and hung up.  That tells me there must be only one tech rep working.  That is just horrible service.  Disappointing since we pay a premium to do business with them - and you pay it upfront.  Go elsewhere....run away."

Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,D. Williams,"Wednesday, October 1, 2014","I looked at Cloud 9 a year ago but didn't decide move forward due to cost.  I wish I would have purchased earlier because we saw instant improvement for our remote employees who can log in at home and access Quickbooks and Sage. Also, before  we had to send data files via email and that was also a security risk but not any longer. The speed was faster than I expected as well. Are they perfect?  No. We had an issue with the initial setup but we quickly resolved it. I recommend their services whenever I can."
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,CPA,"Sunday, August 24, 2014",I've had issues with tickets having to get recreated multiple times to get an issue resolved.  Login issues are a big problem for me because I work with others remotely.  It is unacceptable to take 3 days to resolve a login issue.  I wanted to get out of the prepaid contract and it's impossible.  The customer service is not good.  Once you express dissatisfaction they don't even return calls.  I was also quoted a price and they increased it.  
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Alicia Dolce,"Tuesday, June 24, 2014","If you only remember a few words of this review - remember ""Buyer Beware"" .   Our company signed up for the 12-month plan, (as it is the most cost effective) but quickly realized that Cloud9 was a terrible fit for hosting Quickbooks Enterprise  for our company (we are a construction business) for a number of reasons.First, as the reviewer from March '14 shared, we are an East Coast company and suffered the same lack of access to tech support due to West Coast hours.   Second, we had a number of issues with our start-up and there was no one avail in tech support to assist us when we needed.  As a result, we had to outsource and pay our computer tech consultant a hefty sum to get Cloud9 set-up and running.  During set-up, we realized that some of the supposedly user-friendly interface features (on the dashboard) are not avail if you are a Mac based company (we are) and/or sign-up with the basic business plan. Cloud9 doesn't tell you that in their free webinar (sales) presentations.   As a result, the log-in procedure is not very quick or that user friendly. Additionally, we had purchased an industry specific version of Quickbooks (Contractor) and Cloud9 doesn't tell you that the 'Accountant' version of the software is the default version which opens up each time you log onto the cloud and there is no way to change that.  So, in order to get to your preferred industry version, you essentially have to sign-in twice in order to toggle to your version.  It may not sound like a big deal but  logging-in to their cloud and then opening up your company file is cumbersome enough without having to perform yet another log-in step/task to get to the version of software you purchased.   Considering how expensive Enterprise software is,  it wasn't acceptable and we felt duped that Cloud9 doesn't accurately represent their cloud environment for  Quickbooks Enterprise.The bottom line is that we realized that Cloud9 was not going to work as our cloud-hosting company within 2-3 days of trying to go live with it and when we expressed our concerns to them -- we were told, there was absolutely no refund or recourse.  Basically - we were trapped for the year and they refused to offer us any type of refund even though they knew we were not satisfied and had difficulty with their service from day #1.We were so dissatisfied, we ended up leaving Cloud9 even though we'd only been with them a short time.  All in all, it ended up being a very costly error for us.And that is my number #1 complaint.  Cloud9 does not offer any type of demo of their cloud hosting platform and experience.  Furthermore, we were told by our sales rep, that if we wanted to go with the 12 month plan, we could only exercise that upfront vs. going month to month and then locking in for the year.As the other reviewer stated, unless you've worked in the cloud before, there is no way you are going to be able to evaluate the experience and ""fit""  before you try it out and with Cloud9's no demo/no refund policy, you will be locked in whether you like it or not.Cloud9's business model does not make any sense.  The company we are with now has both a demo program and a 30 day trial.  Looking back, I can see now how important that is and I would urge anyone considering making the move to the cloud, to rethink entering into a contract with Cloud9 based on their current policies. "
Cloud9 RealTime,www.cloudninerealtime.com,Paul Mulcahy,"Monday, March 31, 2014","I subscribed to this service on a 12-month plan. Very quickly I realized that it was not for me. The first issue was they dont open their office till 11am east coast time. I start at 6 am and needed help. They tell you to pull a ticket and someone will get back to you. They only have one tech working. I would often have left the office before they would call me back. Then they cant do anything because Im not at my computer. I had to work late at night or make time during the day to resolve. On weekends noting, I work for myself sometimes working weekends is all have sometime but not cloud 9 they are not open. Just one morning working with cloud 9 real time.I needed to send a client a change order to be signed before I sent the workers to do the job. With the workers in transit and the client waiting I could not get the system to work, hence couldn't give the client the account information. It was the type of client that I had to get a signature. I ended up calling the workers and canceling them. I had to listen to a client go on and on about the situation. I've lost the client and I had to pay the employees for there time. Cloud 9 Customer service  zero.Just some of the issues. 	Could not print  no drivers. They ended up installing them a number of times via screen sharing. When they do get it right you will end up with a lot of drivers in your printer choices. Careful, if you dont pick the correct one you will freeze the system.	Once drivers were installed I couldn't print checks. The information and dollar amounts will not sit on the check line. So you cant use your envelop with the window. Its pretty frustrating have to hand write the names address and return info when youre not expecting it. Then their solution is to contact your printer companys support and have them fix the issue.	Cant upload company logos. File problems.. Most uploads are a problem.	 They have multiple severs which need time to sync. No good if youre in a hurry.	They restrict you from connecting to drop box or other file sharing services. 	You cannot download pretty much anything from the internet. 	Cant be used on smart phones. The only mobile devises are I pad.	 You can only use Internet explorer when logging in via their Internet portal. I use a mac.. Why would I use internet explorer.. 	When I was at a remote computer, (my client). No internet explorer.. Hotel computers.. nop..	 You cannot scan straight from your scanner. You have to put it on your computer then copy and paste over. Dont expect to be productive here.	When youre on their site your constantly confused by their choice of terms. E.g. login = username = account name = account number... But you only realize this after searching for your account info reading all and that and then you realize that they use different terms that mean the same thing and visa versa on a number of items. I blew 20 - 30 minutes on many occasions trying to do the most basic stuff. This service has a lot of problems working with Mac. The customer care or support is not motivated at all. At one point I install parallels to see would that help. NO NO NO. they dont support that either. The Director of Technical Services asked me not to cancel the account and give it another try while they work to fix the issues. He would give me a free month while they work with me and if I decided to cancel I could with a full refund. I was never expecting to hear. The same guy denying making the promise once I ultimately decided to cancel. Keep in mind that they give you 15 DAYS to cancel yes 15 days. Now that I know more about this, there is no way you can tell if hosting your companies files on their cloud is working for you in 15 days. It will take you more than that to figure out all the work arounds and clinchs it has. Then its too late they got your money. By now when your feeling completely pissed off and your bookkeeping is all over the place. Then they start with their games about sending you to accounting and I didn't say this and I didn't say that. Frankly Im not sure dose QuickBooks realize how bad this company is in hosting there software. I am a QuickBooks pro advisor and a business consultant for the construction industry with over twenty years of experience. This is a very bad service and you need to be very careful where you put your business files. "

Kudos to your tech support staff and response times to issues. I was really irritated recently when I discovered that my ip range was being blocked by spamhaus due to another company that was using your hosting service spamming. Spamhaus had blocked a whole range of IPs and I was unable to send out and respond to business emails. I was shifted to a new ip this week within 48 hours and the problem was resolved. I'm managing this site and I am not the most tech proficient individual, but whenever I have an issue, the tech staff is always most helpful and I think they go above and beyond the call of duty.

Smartsheet,www.smartsheet.com,Will Sullivan,"Wednesday, June 13, 2012","We've been using SmartSheet for nearly a year for all of our project management and coordination needs. There seems to be no end to the usefulness of this tool. It's easy to implement and share, clients pick it up quickly, and it's incredibly powerful for organizing virtual project teams who are located in disparate geographic locations.  The only reason I didn't give the product 5 stars on value is due to the pricing models. However, I see that they've recently changed their approach to this and hope we're able to explore that option soon. It is incredible value for the money, but I'm pleased to see they are adding flexibility to their pricing for boutique agencies like us.  There have only been a handful of occasions where I've needed to contact the help desk with an issue. It's quite intuitive and the help files are easy to navigate. When I have contacted help, they've always been responsive, polite, patient and....helpful. It's been months since we've had to contact help, though. The tool hums along pretty smoothly once you have it up and running.  We just started experimenting with sheet-to-sheet linking, which is kind of game-changer for us. I like how they're always adding updated features like this, and looking to integrate with the tools that are in use in the market. Why reinvent the wheel when you can support your customers' existing behavior. Smart move, SmartSheet. "

Any company, manager or executive will quickly find its utility in a wide range of applications and uses."
Smartsheet,www.smartsheet.com,Ian Ray,"Friday, June 8, 2012","We initially used Smartsheet to manage a multi-year project, but immediately found Smartsheet useful for a number of other things. Our company uses Smartsheet to track preventative maintenance, employee requests, food safety issues, and accepting submissions from online contests.  Now, when a request for a new software function comes in, I try throwing the concept at Smartsheet first before designing custom code. Most of the time, Smartsheet is all we need to manage a process or project. The integration with Google Docs makes Smartsheet especially useful as anything that Smartsheet can't handle can be linked by a single Smartsheet row to a Google Spreadsheet."

I had a server with them once, the server would be out for days (yes days not minutes or hours) and they fraudulently billed my credit card. I got most of my money back even after supposed time limits but I had to press hard with help of CFPB. They are not a legit company.

They simply hope you'll get scared and pay. Luckily whatever credit card I used is no longer valid. I'm tired of the harassment and will be contacting my attorney, save yourself the trouble."

It costs $5 to put in a support ticket. You read that correct. They charge you $5 USD to put in ANY support ticket.  This is not a professional or reputable company. I'm very glad I used paypal and never gave them my credit card. No one should use this company when so many real providers exist.

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Joshua Byrd,"Friday, January 9, 2015","I signed up for the ""Free"" service, and was prepared to even pay the ""$0.50"" a month ""Service Fee"". The VPS was terrible and didn't even work when I went to use it. I had to open a support chat (proper support tickets cost $5) to even get the VPS to run. And when it did run it was slow and terrible, so I went to Amazon AWS. But when I then went to cancel the service after a month, I found that I had been slapped with a $5 ""Volume"" fee and couldn't cancel my account without first paying that. Do not sign up. Go somewhere else. Avoid at all costs."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Jeremy Wooten,"Tuesday, November 25, 2014","I came across FortaTrust for the first time in their website. $4 for a 2GB SSD instance with 1 core and a performance much better than my Ec2 instance.After doing much through research on who they were and reading a-lot of reviews. I signed up for the service. So far the experience is great.Things I liked about them right away:	Easy, no-brainer pricing model	Interface is much cleaner and nice to navigate.	Price itself!	Amazing pricing.They did ask me for a personal identification and would not let me do anything before their validation, which is acceptable seeing their reasons for doing so. It was not a problem, the verification was finished within 5 minutes of signup!Now, time to start off that first instance.Their claim of ""launching a new instance instantly"" actually worked! Though they said it might take longer, depending on system load. But, hey that is a good sign of honesty and even though I care less if it took another two three seconds, it finished well before 2 minutes.After logging into the server and changing the root password, it felt much faster than my Ec2 instance.So far so good! At-last now my server will run forever."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Claude Mraz,"Thursday, November 20, 2014","Because I discontinued my co-location enviornment, I needed a place to host the few personal sites I have. I remember hearing about FortaTrust a few times, then I noitced it on the bottom of the netcraft website. FortaTrust was a very attractive company, on visiting their site, the pricing was a sure 10/10. I immediately purchased a VPS from them. I then had to contact support, and got a reply within 10 minutes via their ticket system. When I first saw the ticket had a reply, I thought it was a automated reply, and clicked on it simply to clear the notification. It was a human, with a knowledgebase article on setting up vM instances, and welcoming me. Then every reply I made got a response again in under 10 minutes.I will be sticking with FortaTrust, I've set up vHosts on a VPS, by following the step-by-step guide. I highly recommend FortaTrust for all your cloud needs, they are truly incredible!"
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,HostZealot,"Thursday, November 13, 2014","Fortatrust.com stores credit card numbers and does unauthorized charges! We signed up with FortaTrust.com for colocation in Panama July 29th 2014 in order to expand our capacities to Panama. The order got duplicated occasionally, as well as an invoice. Due to having the Credit card added on our account, FortaTrust.com charged it for both orders, even so the trouble ticket was risen immediately with request to cancel the duplicated order. Since that time, there have been neither response from Fortatrust.com Billing department nor from General phone support (at 1.855.201.7888 or other phone numbers on the website). We received random responses from anonymous General support representatives via Ticket system 'your request has been forwarded .... and will be handled shortly'. So far, the card has been charged 8 times.

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Dan,"Thursday, October 30, 2014","THIS IS A SCAM! One of the worst experiences I have ever had with a hosting company! I cancelled the account -- through their process -- after 12 hours. There was no contact from the company, they triple billed my CC and after cancelling the account (again after 12 hours) it still took another 12 hours before I got a welcome email and login instructions. I had to put a block on my CC cause they still continue to try and charge it and the only communication I have from the company is from threats from a Telio, Rodrigo although the signature in his email is someone else Octavio Diaz. They dont answer their phones or respond to emails. They are only there to collect the signup fee and provide no service."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Brett Phillips,"Wednesday, October 1, 2014","Well, weve officially hit 35 servers with FortaTrust and I feel that this is a good time to write up a review of the service, network, and support qualities that weve received. The road has been mostly smooth, with some small and large bumps along the way, but we couldnt be any happier with the quality of service that weve received and (hopefully) will continue to receive.As our project progressed, we had our growing pains. FortaTrust was always there to help in giving us a discount when necessary, or by knocking off a few bucks here and there on hardware upgrades.Now, several years later, were still with FortaTrust and were happier than ever. We just hit our 35th server, all of which weve ordered since December. Overall, support has always been outstanding. From the time when we had 1-2 servers to now when we have 35 servers: Theres no difference in quality of support. Its all as good as one could hope for.FortaTrusts Provisioning can be picky sometimes. Ive seen some cases where itll roll out weird partitioning, or the servers end up with the wrong hardware or in the wrong datacenters. It can be pretty frustrating. After we had it happen to 3-4 servers, it appeared to magically fix itself, so Im sure development fixed what ever was causing the issues.The other issue that weve had fairly consistently is IP address assignments. I cant really blame FortaTrust for that, though. IPv4 is nearly fully depleted in the US and FortaTrust actually ran out of IPs for a week or two. They ended up getting another large block (of an unknown size) about a week after they ran out. Hopefully itll last us a while. Weve got over 90 IP addresses at this point, so we do go through a lot of them.Past whats noted, I cant think of anything else thats been considered negative. They really do help us grow and are letting us do so at an outstanding rate.Id love to give extra thanks to our account reps over time from when weve grown small to large. Rodrigo helped us in the very beginning when we were first starting to grow. He did an absolutely amazing job as our account rep.  In short, the FortaTrust Staff has been an amazing group. "
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Wayne Hopkin,"Friday, September 19, 2014","Ok so I'm hosting with FORTATRUST for a couple of months right now and wanted to post a review. There are a lot of negative and positive reviews about FORTATRUST so I'll try to be as objective as I can here. I'm not working for FORTATRUST or anything, I'm just a customer.First some history,I have 2 dedis in South Florida and a few weeks ago I opened one in their Panama location. I run game servers, very high risk machines when it comes to DDoS attacks and I've been under attack for almost 2 years, where the attacks ranged from 1 - 30 gbps in size. In these 2 years I've been hopping from one provider to another, either getting kicked by the host because of DDoS attacks, or leaving myself because the protection wasn't sufficient and prices were too steep.FORTATRUST's prices are very competitive. Just check out their site.Delivery times seem to be different based on the location and server you choose. Whatever server you pick you can see how long it will take for your server to be delivered, this can range from 120 seconds to 10 days. For my USA  servers I think it took about a day.That being said, what I don't like about their USA location is that most servers are sold out. Also you can't have any custom configuration. E.g. I wanted to upgrade my connection from 100 mbps to 1 gbps but this was not possible. The more expensive servers come with 1 gbps but they were sold out so for USA your options can be limited.Here comes the best part though, which not one other provider can compete with right now which is FORTATRUST's DDoS protection. Every server comes with free Anti-DDoS pro which means you can adjust settings, filter ports, you can pretty much do anything you want and if you have a serious DDoS problem, moving your servers to FORTATRUST will be your final solution. Every location can filter up to 160 gbps which is way more than any kid can sent to your server.Now for Panama, everything is different again, no API just a control panel which is much more easy to use. You can just force mitigation to always on, leave it on automatic, add/remove firewall rules just like that, here's a screenshot (Any sensitive info removed):As you can see in the web panel, monitoring is disabled. FORTATRUST monitors your server and will auto create a ticket if it doesn't respond to pings. Since I disable ICMP with iptables I had to disable this feature.So to conclude, all in all hosting with FORTATRUST has been a great experience for me so far. I never payed that less and recieved so much for it. I'm sure similar services with professional companies will cost you thousands of dollars a month but thanks to FORTATRUST, the small hoster can have the same protection now as the enterprise companies like Mastercard and Paypal have which is awesome. So would I recommend FORTATRUST, for sure.Let's sum it all up:Pros:- Stable connections, low latency.-Anti-DDoS system.- Anti-DDoS pro, customize your settings, filter out ports etc.- Latest hardware on their dedis.- Very competitive pricing.Cons:- Support is not that great.- Lot of different management interfaces can get really confusing."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Gilbert Pattison,"Thursday, September 18, 2014","I have now been with FortaTrust 15 months and couldn't be happier with the service I've received.  It has now been 9 months since and we have doubled our customer base while continuing to enjoy the rock solid network and expert support. Just to brag a bit, we have 2 servers that have reached over 400 days uptime.The past year has been crazy for us and FortaTrust has had no issue keeping up. We are constantly testing new systems and swapping out hardware, not once have they failed to come through on a special request from us - and we have a lot! What is important to me is the personal service and flexibility. Out of all the providers I have used in the past FortaTrust is still #1 in this regard. All of our servers are unmanaged yet they still come through for us when that bit of managed help is needed.Since my last review I also had the pleasure of flying out to Fort Lauderale to meet the FortaTrust team and tour the datacenter where my servers are located. James and Jorge took time out of their busy schedules to not only give us a tour of the DC but also personally showed us around the area and made sure we were taken care of for the 4 days we were there. Their personal commitment to their customers extends far beyond that of making sure our servers are online and that is why we continue to choose FortaTrust for all of our server needs."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Josh Behrman,"Tuesday, September 9, 2014","Hi, my name is Josh, and I love technology. I was growing my company in a bunch of different directions. I spent almost 2 whole weeks researching solutions to my problem of needing various servers for various needs, protecting against each other, some being more CPU heavy, some being more memory heavy, etc. I ended up deciding what I really needed was a private cloud where I could have a bunch of resources at my disposal, and then allocate them to the various sub-systems as I needed.I went to a bunch of companies including rackspace, amazon, ovh, FortaTrust, and more and asked for advice. They all agreed what I was looking for was a private cloud. I then asked for quotes on the packages, and started digging into these forums for reviews for each of the providers. I ended up deciding some of the companies prices were too high or did not meet my needs perfectly. I went onto chat one night when I was home for Spring Break I believe with FortaTrust, and I met this amazing salesman named Lee. He took the time to understand exactly what I was trying to do, and the first thing he said to me was ""I don't know what the best solution for you is at the moment Adam, but why don't I talk to some of my specialists and get back to you."" I was slowly approaching a deadline of moving off my old host since the contract was going to expire, but I said to myself ""eh, i got nothing to lose. I can wait another day or two.""Lee got back to me, we had conversations I believe for almost 2 weeks back and forth trying to decide what was the best option for me along with some of his specialists. I know during that time he was also going through some family crisis, but even through that he still took the time to get back to me as often as he could with the information I was trying to request. I was baffled by his dedication, and said to myself ""If this guy is going through such hardships and is still taking the time to help me out, then just imagine how the rest of the staff is.""Well thanks to Rodrigo, i ended up settling with an ICE solution from FortaTrust. It was exactly what I needed. Currently it is more of a dedicated VPS setup, but as my business grows I plan to make it into a full blown cloud with more hypervisors, a more powerful SAN, and 100% uptime guarantee.Going back into the staff itself, I have had nothing but great service from these guys. I spoke with the GM Steve through a couple of emails, and he was very nice and understanding of the various components that I wanted to discuss. I had a few specialists including Barry, Dan, and Tom help me out over time with various things such as getting me familiar with proxmox, or helping me configure network issues. Dan recently came up with the brilliant idea of disabling UDP traffic completely on one of my IP's that was suffering from DDOS attacks (minecraft server, go figure). Since this I have not had a single attack on the server, and it is running perfectly still. Tom recently spent a lot of late nights with me on the phone helping to debug some SAN crashes (software related, most likely outdated kernel issues) and shrinking down some of my partitions (which is not easy to do) with gparted and clonezilla after many other failed attempts.I think that is enough of me ranting. These guys are good, and they really take the time to help you. I own an unmanaged service, but these guys still don't turn me down when I need help. I love it at FortaTrust, and I hope my business continues to grow and succeed so that I can continue giving these guys my business.Don't get me wrong, nothing is ever perfect. As far as the 100% uptime, I wouldn't really claim that, as its partially true, partially not true. I had one issues about 2-3 weeks in my first month where my VM's went down a few times during the day because of some network misconfigurations internally and traffic was being routed to the wrong places. Of course they compensated me for the downtime, and took full responsibility. As far as their electrical and overall datacenter uptime, that has been 100% so far. The internal hiccups here and there has been 99.9%.Below is my final ratings I suppose of this wonderful company:Tech Support: 10/10Networking Knowledge: 10/10Price: 10/10Friendliness: 10/10Uptime: 10/10Hardware failures: 0 to dateDowntime total: 1 hour in 4 monthsI don't think there is much else I can say for this review at the moment.FortaTrust is a wonderful company and I would recommend using them if you are searching for a new host."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Richard,"Friday, August 29, 2014","Just a word of caution. BBB rating is F for a reason. They billed us twice for a single service and won't refund one. If you open a ticket, it'll be closed with no explanation. If you try to call, good luck getting an answer."

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Spener,"Friday, July 18, 2014","Someone registed my name, and somehow my old address and phone number under buying a server (or whatever) from them.  They emailed me a few times about paying it, but I was just confused because I was unsure to what the company exactly was.  I had never even heard of them.  I sent an email requesting the account that had been made with them be deleted, but I never got an email back.  Then all of the sudden I get an email where they claim they're going to put it on my credit?  I'm 16 years old, and they have me worried over nothing.  I don't have a good experience with them thus far, and I really hope they reply to this last email regarding this account thing.."

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Elias Guzman,"Friday, June 27, 2014","To those of you who might be considering a new company to provide you with cloud computing services...I have been a FortaTrust customer for over 2 years. The primary reason why I have always stayed with FortaTrust is quite simply... the service. The support staff are knowledgeable, patient and respond quickly. When a problem is discovered I have found first hand that FortaTrust always stands behind their products/services. Take for example an incident that occurred last month.While troubleshooting a SMART alert on my dedicated CentOS box we (the FortaTrust support staff and myself) realized that there had been a mistake made by the original FortaTrust build team on my server configuration. I had been paying for RAID-1 SATA however during our troubleshooting we discovered that there was only one hard drive in my server! Naturally I was immediately concerned not only because I had been paying for a service that I was not receiving (the RAID-1) but also because my client's could suffer if there was a hard drive failure. Most importantly I was concerned with any potential down time my customers might experience while we attempt to fix the issue since you can't simply slap a second drive in and enable RAID-1.FortaTrust acknowledged and took ownership of the mistake and immediately notified their sales team. By the next day I was presented with various options including moving to a new server that included SIGNIFICANTLY more horsepower than my original dedicated server at the same monthly rate.Within a 24-hour period I had heard from the FortaTrust billing department, two members of the sales/quality staff, Rodrigo (the general manager), and I had been assigned the assistance of John (one of their most experienced support staff).Being the detail oriented person that I am, I did not make their lives easy. I wanted every T crossed both before, during and after moving my clients to the new server. Through it all, every member of the FortaTrust team made themselves available, was understanding of my situation and patient in making me happy. The fact that they made Jay available to me for an entire week was worth more than I can say.In the end, I was credited for the RAID-1 fees I had paid, I was upgraded to a MUCH better server, and I was walked through the migration process step-by-step.FortaTrust certainly lived up to the true meaning of customer service and I walked away a very happy customer. I look forward to continuing to be a FortaTrust customer for many years to come!"
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Arif Minhas,"Monday, June 23, 2014","These guys are crooks. They have a habit of over charging.

It is again being repeated - they have over charged me 8 times in the last 12 monts - three times a month or twice a monthTakes forever to get a refund - I don't trust a company that cannot have its billing straight - which automation they use to charge a customer 3 times in a month for a service that that ""monthly""""Love to hear from others who have faced similar problems."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Marcus Deighton,"Tuesday, June 17, 2014","I'm sure that most of you have heard about Fortatrust, especially from the interesting constant Fortatrust vs DigitalOcean rivalry. I am here to provide my review of Fortatrust, as a long time customer who was skeptical at first. I was a customer at Fortatrust for about 1 year before I terminated my service. I primarily used it for learning and experimenting since Fortatrust seemed to be suitable for beginners. You could make mistakes and screw up entirely and everything would still be ok (I will explain that a little later).. Just like every provider, there are strengths and weaknesses. While Fortatrust certainly has its fair share of weaknesses, the strengths make up for that. To begin, I would just like to say that the performance and speed of a Fortatrust VPS is absolutely amazing. If I didn't know any better, I would believe they were dedicated servers to be honest. It seems all of their servers make use of quad core processors. Oh and to mention, they have many linux distributions to choose from: Current Distributions:CentOS (i386 and x86_64) Debian  (i386 and x86_64) Fedora (i386 and x86_64) Slackware (i386 and x86_64) Ubuntu (i386 and x86_64) OpenSUSE  Gentoo (i386 and x86_64) You can also roll your own distribution and upload it. The distributions above are i386 unless specified otherwise. Isn't that just great? Yes, it sure is.. And it's easy to set them up too! You can switch at any time with simple clicking of buttons on the custom Fortatrust VPS web control panel, known as the Fortatrust manager. Now lets get into the more important things, shall we? At first, the packages seemed to be a bit different than normal. My first thought was, wow that is expensive compared to most VPS providers. I found the average was around 40-50 GB Disk Space, and 2 GB RAM for $4!! But let me tell you, when I finally decided to go through with it and try them out, I had no regrets. With the high performance and stability, I didn't need anything better, so I got more value than what I paid for. Recently, about a month ago, Fortatrust increased the amount of RAM for their packages.I will also tell you this... I have never had to reboot my VPS for any reason, except when I wanted to upgrade or installed something that required it. Most of the other fellow Fortatrust customers will tell you the same. Now this Fortatrust manager is so awesome! The instant I purchased my Fortatrust and created my account, I was able to login and choose a Linux distribution. I set the amount of swap space I wanted, and everything else. After that, it showed a button to ""Start"" the VPS. I clicked it and within minutes, there it was! From the Fortatrust manager, I was able to do many things such as rebooting or wiping the VPS and installing a different Linux distribution. It even had listed the current jobs that were ordered and that it is performing (shut down, start up, reboots, etc.), and an ETA of when they would be finished. The Fortatrust manager also had a built in ""Lassie watchdog"" which started the VPS every time it went down, if it ever did that is. That was actually a slight problem, if I wanted to completely shut the VPS off for a few days or something and did so by issuing the shutdown command in SSH, stupid Lassie started it up again! So I had to resort to using the shutdown button on the Fortatrust manager.. In the Fortatrust manager, I could also look at network graphs, disk IO graphs, and many other useful graphs. The best thing about this that most companies lack in, Fortatrust kept up the communication to the customers every step of the way. Whenever they found out about something, customers were the first to know. They provided us with full accurate details. It just so happened to be a hard drive failure. After about 30 minutes of investigating to see whether they could salvage everyone's data and finding out it was impossible, they opened up a support ticket for every client that was on that host node, stating that we would be issued credit for 2 months of service and moved to a new host node. They completely honored this and it was done within 20 minutes. They seem to do this for nearly everyone who ends up having this kind of problem. And unlike most providers, Fortatrust's staff seem to always be greatly saddened by things like this, because it hurts their goals and mission to provide exceptional quality of service.Other than those types of problems that are out of anyone's control, Fortatrust is a superb VPS provider!!I have to say, I am very pleased with Fortatrust as a whole. One thing though, that could be improved is their support. I'm not saying that it is bad, but it isn't great either. They provide a lot of self help services like a Wiki, forums, and have a community IRC channel, as well as a 24/7 ticket system. When you create a ticket, it is usually responded to within 10 minutes. The ticket support is excellent! But to be honest, most of us prefer live support via live chat. Fortatrust does have a phone number which I have not used. I prefer live chat. So I figured I would use the community IRC channel to replace the lack of live chat support. In doing so, I found that around 60-70% of the Fortatrust community (mostly customers of Fortatrust) are arrogant and rude. I mean, they provide excellent help to people, even beginners. But if you ask anything about certain things (perhaps IRC related, or network speeds), they will go off on you like there's no tomorrow, and provide the most smarta** comments ever. ""It's fast, that's all you need to know."" Even the Fortatrust staff who frequent the IRC channel are just about as rude and arrogant in their responses in the IRC channel. But when it comes time to the ticket system, it's like they're completely different people. Professional and very friendly.. One thing I dislike is when people try to force their ways and their preferences onto others. This is exactly what they do in the IRC channel. You ask for help with fixing your Gentoo setup or something, and you'll often get a response like, ""Gentoo is crap! Go with Ubuntu."" My thoughts would be, ""I didn't ask what Linux distribution you think I should go with. I asked for help with fixing a problem with my Gentoo setup! If I wanted to use Ubuntu, I would have done so.."" It's simple things like that, really frustrates you at times. Though again, they're not always like this, only 50% of the time when they're in those moods that they are better than you. Their response to people asking about DDoS protection seems a bit lame too... ""We don't have DDoS protection."" ""Oh wait, we do.. If you attract DDoS attacks, we will show you to the door."" While that is in theory, an interesting way to prevent attracting customers who always attract DDoS attacks, it isn't a good idea to tell the whole world that. I mean, what if there's people lurking around thinking to themselves, ""Ohh, I don't like that guy just because he likes the Fedora linux OS, so I think I will find out his server IP and hit him with a DDoS attack and get his service terminated!"" Very bad idea.. Once again, other than those slight issues, I've never had any major problem with Fortatrust and would absolutely put my full faith and trust in referring them to anyone who asks. They are, without a doubt, one of the best if not the best VPS providers around today.  Rating: Price: 8/10Support: 9/10Performance: 10/10Network Speeds/Uptime: 10/10Server Uptime/Stability: 10/10Overall: 9.4/10Oh and one last thing... I have tried running game servers, IRC servers, web servers, and pretty much everything. They all seemed to run perfectly smooth. I was really impressed at what I could run and how much of it I could run all at once and still have absolutely brilliant performance. At one time, I ran an IRC server, 3 game servers (private counter strike 1.6, 32 slot public counter strike 1.6, and a 32 slot public counter strike source). Even with them all being used, the performance was still superb. It ran circles around dedicated services I've used.Lastly, allow me to apologize for making this review so long. There was just a lot that I wanted to cover in order to give you folks a good insight of what to expect of Fortatrust.."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Chris O'Neill,"Friday, June 13, 2014","After some bad experiences with my former webhosting company, I decided to try FortaTrust. Back then I've found numbers of good reviews, and they were big enough to be recognized, so I told myself ""why not"".I'm familiar with WHM/cPanel, so I decided to stick to it instead of learning command lines and etc. It was only $12 extra for each month, which is one of the lowest price I've found. Their nodes however, aren't the cheapest.I've ordered 1GB (back then each nodes were 256MB), but apparently my server wasn't as fast as I wanted to be. It took me couple of weeks of googling and reading 'til I could optimize my WHM/cPanel LAMP VPS with limited resources. It still had hiccups time to time, so I finally gave in and upgraded to the next level; since then it's been running rock solid; today's actually the 220th day of my server running without a single outage/downtime. Impressive.I'm the guy who asks many, many questions. Their support team was patient enough to answer many of my novice questions. Well, if server goes down though, they really didn't help out much other than saying ""try to upgrade nodes"". My VPS was unmanaged and upgrade did help my situation, so what can I say. If you're into WHM/cPanel VPS, I think FortaTrust is a good place to start. Their network is fast indeed, and I had no problems.Another plus is its speed of deployment/nodes upgrade. It was quick and smooth. Downgrading however, took many hours, more hours than they suggested.Again, if you need VPS servers with WHM/cPanel, I wouldn't hesitate recommending FortaTrust. But if you compare prices with other smaller, low end VPS hosting companies, FortaTrust feels bit overpriced. In other words, if you know how to run servers with command line and comfortable without any control panels, you probably wouldn't benefit much from them.And though they try to keep customers by upgrading their nodes, their pace is way too slow. For 12  months I was being with them, they upgraded memory and bandwidth ONCE. See, it's not so bad, but compared to other companies price isn't still too attractive, especially if you're intermediate/advanced server admin - for the monthly price I'm paying now, I purchased a whole year's worth of VPS from other company.

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Robert Moskowitz,"Thursday, June 12, 2014","When I first started looking at Cloud hosting, I did quickly hear about two services, Amzaon AWS  and FortaTrust. One month ago I signup for an account with them, and have used their USA Data Center since that. As always I started with a small VPS plan, to test uptime, network, hardware etc. Here is my review of FortaTrust.Product/hardware/priceFortaTrust is a true cloud host;  they offer cloud features like pay by the hour, snapshots, templates, quick deployment, use your credit to create lots of servers, backups, several locations etc. But still, you get a normal KVM server. They have High Availability,  Fail-Over,  Own ISO, External Firewall with GUI etc .But still, they have a really good product. Its super simple to create new instances, it takes only around 55 seconds before it is online (you get the root password on e-mail)Their prices starts at $4/mo or $0.003/hour. You pay for what you use, and they do only bill by the hour. But they do charge you 100% regardless of your servers is turned on or off. Still, you can create a template, and delete your server, then recreate it later on when you need it, without paying for it. They do not charge for template/backup disk space.Service/SupportThe first (and only) time I used their support so far, it was a mixed experience. I asked them some really short and clear questions, and got replies back. But I had stumbled on a little trade secret, that the normal support guy did not know (or wanted to reply on). I did not understand why I could not get any reply, after I had repeated my self for the third time. I then tweeted about this issue, and then it took under 10 minutes before I got a reply, both on twitter and on my support ticket. This time from a Support Specialist. I got a really good explanation on my question, and as a really nice thing I got a credit on my account.BenchmarkThe first test is with a 16 GB 8vCore server, and I got a UnixBench result of 2844. I did then run a test on a 64 GB 20vCore server, and the result was: 4226 points. It currently holds the 5.place on my Top20 list. I could not test their 96 GB RAM 24vCore server, they have disabled it on all locations because of high demand.I get an average of 215 MB/S on my DD test, and thats not so impressive since they offer pure SSD disks on the nodes. I get twice that on iwStack, that only used normal disks in a SAN. Still, 215 MB/s is not bad, but its not Ramnode speeds either.Network/uptimeMy monitoring services tells me that I have a 100% uptime the last 30 days with 1 minute monitors. Im using their USA location for my test server.ConclusionFortaTrust is a complete cloud host, they include cloud features like HA, fail-over, firewall etc,. Servers are deployed within one minute, you can choose from several locations, templates etc. You can create templates and backups that you can transfer from EU to US and visa versa.Their servers is really good, you can resize your servers with one click, and their uptime is really good. (the best).Signup and do a test for your self, Im sure you will like DO as much as I do."

I just read their TOS and saw that there's no refund applicable for any of their charges, but they charged me twice without any explanation. Two of my tickets were closed before any real solution, they just said that it would be forwarded to the responsible department and closed it. I am waiting for 2 days and my server is still down. I will need to take this as a lesson and forget about my $90.00. Also, I will cancel my Credit Card I have registered with them. Read other reviews and you will find out why.

Within hours of being online it crashes and goes offline, live chat is useless and leaves you waiting ages, very vague answers as do the support and that's a strong name for what they do.

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Javier Espinosa,"Wednesday, February 19, 2014","I was recently looking for a decently priced VPS where I could host a couple of small to medium sized websites. I actually signed up for a few random ones that I found on Google and tried them for a few days, but they didn't strike me as working very well. One of them actually crashed after about an hour, and it took about eight hours for support to finally restart it for me. Eventually I started looking around the internet a bit more, and ran into a relatively new company called FortaTrust. I realize that not all web companies have nice looking web pages, but whenever I encounter one that does it immediately makes me feel more comfortable about trying it out. One of the claims on the front page really stood out to me: Deploy a SSD Cloud Server in 55 seconds. I had to test it out just to test that claim. Here is my FortaTrust review of their VPS after using it for about a ten days. Signing-up - To get your first cloud server going (FortaTrusts name for a VPS deployment) you have to enter your billing details as well as hand over your credit card. FortaTrust actually offers per-hour billing for all their VPS offerings, so the credit card information is taken just to ensure they can bill you at the end of the month. Their introductory cloud server configuration has 1GB of RAM, 1 CPU core, 20 GB on a SSD drive, and includes 1TB of transfer. I think its a pretty impressive offering, and is more than enough to run a basic web server. As I mostly deal with WordPress websites, I rarely ever hit my disk space limits. But I personally find RAM and the number of cores makes a big difference in the responsiveness of a webserver. Thats why I eventually opted to test out the $20/month plan. While it has more storage space and more bandwidth, I really wanted it for the additional CPU core and RAM, both of which I believe helps with hosting websites. Long story short, so far so good with FortaTrust."

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Tony Sullivan,"Thursday, December 12, 2013","Actually for a few months all was well, but was all downhill after some mechanical problems. I requested and paid for an upgrade server, the company delivered a cheaper package server 2 weeks late but continued billing me for the premium server. They never fully closed the original package, so now I'm being invoiced for a service I don't  have anymore. 1 month later this new server fails. I'm promised a new one, but nothing ever happens. At this point I try to cancel and close the account, which the company insists can only be accomplished by phone. If you try calling them you get a ring tone and nothing OR a messaging system that leads nowhere OR on a good day are told that the line is out of service. Meanwhile invoices are accumulating, and now the company is sending automated legal threats. One star because it is impossible to send no stars."

FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Kanagu,"Friday, September 27, 2013","I was overcharged for 2 months, and I inquired about this and never got a response. They only send emails to pay an amount I already paid. My billing was changed from quarterly ($79) to monthly ($152) without me knowing for 2 months. Once I realized, I contacted them the overcharged amount - but they never respond back. I continually sent tickets and have tried calling various times - but never get an answer. After many weeks I was finally sent a response saying that my ticket was sent to 'manager escalation' and I would have to wait for them to respond. In the meantime, they tried to charge me $157.79 in saying that I have an 'overdue balance' but I already called to my credit card (visa) and told them about the issue and they cancelled any charges with Forta Trust. Right now, I have already been charged for 1 years worth of service with the overcharged payments. They said that they have 'suspended' my service because of the 'overdue balance'. This morning, I was sent an email with the subject: ""Legal Action regarding your Delinquent Account"" from them. I would like to be refunded for the amount that I was overcharged. But more importantly - I would like this type of scamming to be stopped so it doesn't happen to others. This type of problem seems to be a common problem with them. As I review their services online, there seem to be many people who have been scammed by them. For the last 15 years, I have been working on a non-profit ministry using my own time, money and resources. Through my 15 years, I have had a server at many locations and have never missed a payment, and have never had a problem like with these people. I cannot describe how these people treat their customers. I would expect that BBB would resolve this issue - not just for me and those who have already been scammed, but for those who may fall into their trap in the future. This type of issue happening in a democratic country is not right. We need justice. Righteousness always wins."

Unfortunately I did not choose their services  I had an account with ServerPronto and FortaTrust took over one of their data centers, so they inherited my account. On January 22nd this year I ordered an upgraded server on the understanding that I would continue to use the current server until the new server was deployed. However I was billed for the new server. After 2 weeks the server was still not available, so I threatened to cancel my account. The issue was escalated to management and on Feb 23 I received an e-mail promising a refund. After waiting a week for this refund, I followed this up only to be told that the money had supposedly been withdrawn from their account to fund the refund, but yet we received nothing. This exchange continued back and forth with numerous promises to resolve the issue. Needless to say we did not receive any refund. However because FortaTrust had our credit card details they continued to bill us for both servers, even though neither was being used. Repeated requests to de-commission the server were met with promises to do so but nothing was ever done. After 4 months this has never been resolved and I have had to replace my credit card to stop them billing me. But to add insult to injury Im now receiving termination letters threatening to publish our name to a credit web site for non-payment of our account. Numerous e-mails and tickets logged via their support web site have gone unanswered.  Phone Calls get routed to an answering service. This company is a scam. Never do business with them. "

I wouldn't recommend for a dedicated server user, I lose business by my site being down. I'm planning to change to another provider next month. I'm done with their service."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Namir Jansen,"Thursday, July 12, 2012",I ordered 2 of the new 8 core - 8GB servers with custom OS's with no issue. I spoke with an agent and I mentioned my need for more than 1 server.  They quickly put me in touch with a manager who provided a custom solution and a great discounted price. The servers are good and the staff are good. I am glad I found them.
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Raul Ramos,"Wednesday, July 11, 2012","I purchased an 8 core dedicated server from them for less than $60 about 2 months ago and it took 5 days to be delivered. I wasn't sure at first, but for the price I decided to wait. When I finally received the server, it was much better than what I was expecting. I have to say I was surprised and so far everything is working out. Their tech support has been helpful and friendly, I have not had any problems and everything is running smoothly. I would recommend this service for anyone looking for a low price reliable server."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,John Boston,"Tuesday, July 10, 2012","I am a website developer and I have to manage a few websites, several of which involve a webstore. I've had several different servers, but I found Fortatrust a few years ago and it's been the one place I go to ever since. They host all my websites and as I continue to grow my portfolio, I simply apply for more server space and it's almost instant access. Plus, I don't have many problems on their site, but whenever I do, they're always there to help whenever I need it. "
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,WireShark,"Thursday, June 7, 2012","I've had server pronto dedicated servers for years, it wasn't until recently (after the FortaTrust name change) that I had any issues. After purchasing a recent promotion, I waited 4 weeks and 3 days until delivery. After repeated attempts to get status during this time I was given excuse after excuse. I was only out of pocket $50  so I waited it out, eventually I did receive the server. I'm still on the fence with these guys, not sure exactly whats going to happen, they sometimes leave me feeling a bit like, uh oh, I dont want to have to move my sites once again but I may have too. I hope they get their game together and step up to the responsibility their executives think they're at now.  Sorry guys for the indifferent review but this is reality. You need to be honest with your customers and deliver on what you say you will otherwise Joe Public will never come to the field of dreams. Good luck and I hope to get the warm fuzzies sometime in the near future. One positive i'd like to add, the prices are very reasonable and I dont know of many hosting companies offering Xen and Vmware without additional costs. "
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Chin,"Wednesday, April 25, 2012","Yes, they provide a great deal but the performance is seriously bad. All people in this company are only interested in taking your money.  If you are a customer, please be careful with their policy. You may want to cancel the service two months in advance at least. They put one more process in where you have to send a hand written form. If you go past one months notification with all processes they create, you will end up paying for your service which can be one year if you have a one year contract. Now I use a VPS company and I found out it is much faster, more durable and reliable than ServerPronto and FortaTrust.  I just want to share my bad experience. It was too stressful. After my FortaTrust, ServerPronto Experience, you will be happier with any other provider.You might lose your hair with the stress they give you."
FortaTrust,www.FortaTrust.com,Alex Sanchez,"Monday, April 2, 2012",Prices were great for the products I purchased. I purchased 3 dedicated servers and recieved information to access them about an hour and a half later. I would suggest this company to anyone looking for a quick setup with a great price.

CoreSpace,corespace.com/,Riley Lempriere,"Tuesday, April 28, 2015",I would like to write a short review of Corespace. I have been using their cloud services for about 2 months and I have what to say about them. Account setup: After payment I received account access details and within 35 minutes I had my first VPS created.  I think that indicates they are having great hardware and performance. After some tests I set up my VPS and now I have some stuff hosted there. Everything is working pretty fast. I feel I have a good Data Center and good network providers with my cloud. Support: very fast. I have had several issues with DNS setup and assigning IP. I got my help within 15 minutes. I wish they had faster stuff. No phone support option. In general - good service for the price paid. My sentence - they are recommended.

Digiweb Hosting,hosting.digiweb.ie,Will,"Wednesday, October 15, 2014","Their service has gone down hill since they began and now as I post they have reached rock bottom.  Any of my websites hosted with them which have a database with them are basically grinding to a halt.  Support blames everyone but themselves (when / if they reply at all) and have even changed permissions on files on ALL my sites so I could not login.  Their arrogant, condescending tone is extremely distasteful.  Its got to the point now where I am about to move to LetsHost.  Appalling is all I can call Digiweb!"
Digiweb Hosting,hosting.digiweb.ie,Rob,"Monday, August 4, 2014","Used to be very good and helpful, but a couple of years ago it all went to hell. Downtime was tracked at or above 20% for months, and every time I contacted them I got a lame apology and was assured it wouldn't happen again, or else a snarky mail telling me that it was working fine (of course it is - it took you a week to reply). Can't believe I put up with them for so long! Absolutely incompetent. And as an indication of just how incompetent they are, they're still sending me postal invoices for services even though I left them over a year ago. Rang them up and was just told it was because their system couldn't differentiate who was still a customer and who wasn't. Seriously? Don't go near them."

I did a search and found less annoying. They have the best team, and customer service, also ""in a less annoying way,"" and have helped me grow and organize my contacts, so its sustainable, I use it every time I interact with a new potential client. They have also a really useful mailchimp integration, so I was able to take apart my long contact list, and just integrate into less annoying, so as I add new contacts they are merged, in the easiest way. This way I can send our relevant information to segmented groups.  I can't wait to integrate it further into my website. If you are a startup at day one or day 500, stop messing around and get Less Annoying."

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Dan Baritchi,"Wednesday, February 27, 2013","We recently switched to MaxCDN for serving up the static content (css, js, image files) for our websites - roughly a million requests/day. MaxCDN is what we've always wished others would be like, but they never were. The MaxCDN network just works, serving up our content very fast and reliably. And unlike others, they have a clear cache button for when you need to use it! That means you don't need to keep your expire time set to 24 hours for changes to show up fast. And since MaxCDN offers a pull-type CDN config, there's no need to re-upload your content to a different place. Your files are on your regular web server, and MaxCDN caches them direct from there. Highly recommended. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Sumon Selim,"Wednesday, February 20, 2013",MaxCDN is tremendous! It made my site super fast and as a result I'm getting more traffic.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Phill Healey,"Tuesday, February 19, 2013","At Code Curators we work with a wide range of clients from local architects through to the Worlds leading Aviation sales channel. The MaxCDN network is robust enough to handle such market leaders, delivering fast results from local server no matter where or when potential clients access their network of servers and websites. Furthermore MaxCDN offer a really useful control panel that allows us to create zones as and when we please. Not only that, it allows us individual control over each zone, so that we can customize caching of elements based on their frequency of change without having to go through the hassle of re configuring our own servers. Likewise, the ability to create/edit/delete custom zones means that for our smaller client we can simply create them a zone that taps in to our own data allocation. This means we can offer high speed reliable and highly configured content networks to even our smallest clients. This gives them all the infrastructure of a large scale business without any a more cost than their budget hosting plan. We figured since MaxCDN was so cheap and so good, that there must be an even better deal elsewhere. But trust me there really isn't anything as good for such a great price. But then how could there ever be? If you need/want a CDN don't waste your time looking elsewhere, and don't delay, do it today."

We had a sudden surge in the traffic and our servers were in no position to handle it. There servers just gave up and this even led to drop in rankings in Google SERPs. I needed a good CDN to support my website. In the process found MaxCDN. Using MaxCDN was one of the best things that has happened with our website. Today, we are able to handle all the traffic and even sudden surges with the help of MaxCDN. They are reliable and trustworthy. They do deliver on their promises.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Greg S,"Tuesday, February 5, 2013","As many of the other reviewers have said, MaxCDN is a great service that will definitely increase the speed of your site.

So I looked for ways to speed it up. Everything I read kept talking about CDNs. I did some research and MaxCDN's name would always come up. So I signed up for their service. I'm not good at setting stuff up and I found the process of getting the CDN to work with W3 Cache difficult. It probably isn't that hard, but I couldn't figure it out. Anyway, I emailed MaxCDN support, told them what was going on and they set everything up for me at no extra cost. Now that's great service. Once everything was installed I noticed an immediate improvement in my website's speed. So I'd recommend MaxCDN to anyone who wants to speed up their website. "

We run a few Joomla/K2 and OsCommerce sites that receive higher than normal traffic for shared hosting - performance is suberb and we saved also on bandwidth costs! Let the server handle 1 php page and MaxCDN does the rest! Cool! When a downtime occurs there is a status page and we get informed - traffic is routed to nearby nodes quickly (""downtime"" has occurred twice as I can remember in those years - and is brief, few mins only). We got some problems with their portal and invoice system, they billed the wrong bandwidth but they solved the issue. It would be great if their billing support was a bit better though.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Saturn Tec,"Thursday, January 24, 2013",Since we have started using MaxCDN things are much improved. Load has improved 100%.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Manuel Garcia,"Thursday, January 24, 2013",CDN is a crucial element of my blog as it enhances the blog's user experience specifically loading time - especially for a design blog that showcases 30-50 images per post. MaxCDN is doing a hell of a job minimizing the loading time though there are lots of images on each post. I've been recommending this to my blogger friends and they are fully satisfied too. I hope you give it a try.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Riad Kanane,"Thursday, January 24, 2013","Over the past year, we have had a great experience using MaxCDN. We use it on all of our websites.

Thank you MaxCDN team for being cooperative."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Olawale Daniel,"Thursday, January 24, 2013","I have been using so many other CDN services but  MaxCDN surpasses all my expectations when I tried the service last year. Ever since then, I have been using them and have about two accounts for different sites of mine. I will still subscribe for more services in order to take care of the other 20 websites that I am currently developing. You too should check the company out because I can vouch for them. So, I recommend MaxCDN service with 100% customer satisfaction guaranteed. "

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Cormac Moylan,"Thursday, January 24, 2013","I switched from another CDN service over to MaxCDN after becoming frustrated at the documentation (or lack of it) and technical jargon used across the other system. I had enough. After I discovered MaxCDN is integrated into the W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress, it was a simple decision to switch over to them. Everything went so smooth. Within a couple of hours I had switched to MaxCDN, made a financial saving on costs, and saved my sanity too! The MaxCDN crew are also a brilliant bunch of guys. The special offers and discounts they offer on a regular basis to their customers have won me over countless times. I can't see myself ever moving from MaxCDN to another provider. Highly recommended."

You're website will rank better, you'll have a stronger SEO, and get way more visitors and customers. This will repay your investment, at lest it did it for me. They're cheper than other CDN, their control panel is powerful and easy to learn, and their service is probably the best out there. Try it and you'll love it. Thank you MaxCDN!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Liam Fitzgerald,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","Having used MaxCDN for over 2 years I can say that it's an excellent resource for any designer/developer that manages multiple websites. And now the recently (beautifully) redesigned interface makes it a class-leader. If you've ever struggled with the horror that others CDN offers you will love how simple it is to setup and manage zones on MaxCDN. So why not the full five stars, well they really could use some more servers particularly in the southern hemisphere. However if your main audience is in North America and Europe you'll do well to find better than this! "

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Pepa Cooks,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",My ISP recommended to use MaxCDN to manage the traffic increase. I use wordpress CMS and the configuration and implementation was very easy and everything worked perfectly with W3 Total Cache. I've needed the customer service a couple of times and I've been attended via chat very fast and the issue was detected at the moment. I recommend them
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Maximilian Batz,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","We are using MaxCDN / NetDNA for our blog, and soon for our Raspberry Pi cloud distribution delivery service. It is not our first project based on MaxCDN services. You can go no wrong with them - they are dead simple to implement in WordPress, for instance, and you also have a great push service for large files you want to offload from your server. They have servers in many locations, all with state-of-the art SSD technology. I believe the Asian area is being upgraded right now. Service is quick, personal and friendly. Their e-Mails are witty and their prices are bargain. Do I sound like an ad? Well give them a try and see for yourself."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Bartosz Pacholek,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","MaxCDN is the new big thing in content delivery. It allows you to spread the word (or usually movies, images etc.) Not only faster all around the world, but more reliable as you do not need worry about how to handle millions of requests (especially if you have an media-driven service) and therefore your server can focus on database or script operations giving you the power to produce even more sophisticated solutions and/or websites. MaxCDN Pull-zones are the bullseye of CDNs: almost no configuration, just show where your website is, slightly change URLs in your system. Great support and frequent updates show you how this business is growing and how they do good work for your work to be better."

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Barry White,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I operate a small business in the UK with clients with websites based globally - and when I first learned about CDN I did as much research as I could and finally came across MaxCDN. From the very outset they have been incredibly helpful and supportive - being patient with all my queries and of course with live support available its a brilliant resource to have. Their service has been faultless too in the provision of content delivery - now into my second year I am not aware of any down time or any interruption in service and the sites that I now have using CDN are much faster than they are without it. In short I cannot fault them in their CDN provision and their professional support and would highly recommend them to anyone.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Prakash Thapa,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","We have been using MaxCDN to serve our static assets like CSS, Javascript and Images almost for a year and the impact is awesome.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mentor Palokaj,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","Love it, on a couple of points: 1 Purely on what it is supposed to do: it made my blog many times faster in loading. Especially when combined with a cookie free domain. 2 Integration: it integrates very well with WordPress. My initial fear was to have to manually modify all of my links etc. However it only took a couple of clicks. There was a small delay until it started working (10 mins in my case) though I suspect that was just a delay in the updating of DNS records of my static domain. 3 Service: there just there when you need them."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Gokhan Aydin,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have been using MaxCDN for 6 months. It really supercharged my website. Integrations is super easy, their panel gives detailed statistics to manage bandwith. Their CRM is extreme! I have not requested any support from MaxCDN because everything is working great but they regularly  contact with me to improve my performance and get more benefits from them. Their price is almost free."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Tom Hatzer,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","We've been with MaxCDN for almost a year now and we are very pleased with their service and support. There was a problem with custom .htaccess files once, which got sorted out within 5 minutes after writing an email to the support address.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,David Amodt,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've owned a lot of different websites throughout the years and only recently have known what a CDN network is and how it can greatly help a site. Rather than host all the files on my own sites, the CDN hosts the major contents and can serve up the content quickly. I've heard about MaxCDN and gave them a spin based on colleague reviews. Wow. Easy to setup, easy to navigate and affordable pricing. I'm an advanced techie, but learning how to use a CDN seemed scary at first. The tutorials at MaxCDN and the ease of use was incredibly simple to use and I am a very happy customer. If you're looking for a great CDN network for your site and affordable pricing and great speed, check out MaxCDN. Well worth the service and great customer service."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Javier Munoz,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","Great and reliable service. Very easy to setup with WordPress and W3TC plugin. Managing the zones  and the reports from the website is a bit messy at first, but it becomes easy to understand after a while. Recommended."

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jeremy Webb,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","MaxCDN saved my bacon. As a hobby with a friend. I run a reasonably popular Italian recipe blog. We also have an app. Recently we got the email. We were to be the free app of the day. We were to expect 150,000 downloads and plenty of interest in the site. Time to harden our hosting! We looked around for a content distribution service, and found MaxCDN. The decision to go with them was based on price and ease of set up. I was genuinely surprised how easy it was to implement. We set up a pull zone in a few minutes, and used a plugin for our CMS and we were away! All for a very reasonable price, under $50. So far, so very good. Site performance is probably 30-50% better. I'll certainly consider MaxCDN for other sites. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,David Glen,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have many blogs which run on wordpress platform, as the traffic on these blogs were increasing I wanted to use a CDN to minimize my hosting bandwidth, I am glad to have found MaxCDN.com They save my bandwidth and my bills!

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Krishna Rungta,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have been using MaxCDN for almost a year now. The service has been consistent with a few occasional hiccups. MaxCDN helped reduced our site load time by half! They are also adding more edge locations which is again a plus. Sometimes, their technical support team leaves a bit to be desired. But their CDN network is supreme and I would recommend them."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Siarhei Karotki,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","When I started using MaxCDN service, the speed improvement was mind boggling. Before, I could only get the front page of one of my websites to load in about 5-6 seconds, measured by Pingdom. Now, the front page loads in 2-3 seconds. Another big reason to use MaxCDN is that it integrates with WordPress fairly easily (all of my websites are based on WordPress platform, so it's very important to me that MaxCDN works great with it plus with cache plugins like W3 total Cache). All of my friends who have signed up with MaxCDN have only given them positive remarks."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mohsin Ali Waheed,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I have been using MaxCDN for the last 5 months on all of my blogs and it really changed my life.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jason Rohler,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN has provided an exceptional value to a project I've been supporting.  It was easy to configure and has worked flawlessly since day 1. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mikkie Dikkie,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","MaxCDN is probably the best bang for the buck when it comes to getting a global CDN for your web-application. I have tried many in the past and my conclusion were that the competitors have either been any of 1; Too expensive, 2; No significant performance gain 3; Lots of hassle to implement. I currently use MaxCDN for one of my clients who has more then 4 million page views per month and MaxCDN has helped to take a lot of static load from our server with a very high cache hit-ratio (currently 97.4%). Implementing and setting up MaxCDN is as simple as it gets, you need no coding skills or deeper understanding how it works. You can be up and running with MaxCDN in a couple of minutes if you are just an amateur who runs a WordPress blog or a Drupal site. MaxCDN has also proven to be by far the cheapest CDN solution for us, we will keep use them and we will be connecting more of our clients to MaxCDN this year. As for their support, I honestly can not say as we never had to use it and we have never had a problem with their service. 5 stars from us."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jeetu Tuteja,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN is very easy to use. It was just few minutes job to integrate with my WordPress super cache plugin but on one point when I was confused to delete the cache I clicked on chat support and got the answer in minutes as there was no queue. Fantastic speed and fantastic support with an awesome price. Thanks MaxCDN 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Brandon Drury,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","Last week I started up with MaxCDN. My site is running much faster than ever. Setup took maybe 30 minutes, give or take. I had a problem with their new BETA site, but their tech support was hyper friendly and set me straight super quickly. So far my experience has been great. Their statistics seem to be very up to date and their prices were quite reasonable. It's early for me, but so far my experience has been great!"

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Hussein Bharwani,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I am very happy with MaxCDN. It has been the single most useful change to any of my websites. If I would have known using a content delivery network would be this effective, I would have signed up years ago. The more files your webpage loads from your web server, the more you benefit from this service. I have a website which requires 69 items to be loaded when viewing the site for the first time. The HTML page loads from my single web server, 9 files load from Google and 59 from MaxCDN. Pingdom page test was originally ~1s from NY and ~2-3s from Amsterdam. Now with MaxCDN it is 4-600ms from NY and 6-800ms from Amsterdam! I am so happy with this! I can't stop telling people how fast MaxCDN made my site! And for only around $3/month! I am writing this review to thank MaxCDN for making CDN affordable! Thanks!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Go Zindagi,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",The last thing I wanted was to upload all of my static files all over again to their network. But they offer a pull-zone which basically grabs the files first time from your server and then keeps it in their cache. This saved me about 2 hours of work. Unlike my last CDN they offer gzip compression which is perfect for me. In the cloudfront I spent about an hour reading on how to setup gzip. Definitely MaxCDN is a winner here. Two reasons why their pricing model is superior than others. They do not charge based on number of GET request and that alone saves tons of $$ for me. Can it get better then $10 for 1000GB of bandwidth for a whole year! Network - this is the only thing I don't like. They do not have any locations in Asia where majority of my traffic come from. Support - honestly so far I haven't had to call them or send them an email for anything so that's a good thing in my book so far. They are backed by NetDNA which is relatively new player in CDN market but so far they are doing pretty good job.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Gourav Jain,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have been using Max CDN on almost all my blogs and websites. The reasons are: its easy to use, the price is considerably good than other providers, it has speeded up my websites drastically, my Hosting expenses have decreased a bit after I have offloaded my images and some other site files to the CDN. Also, my servers didn't crash when an article on my site went viral and brought in a flood of traffic. Thank god the CDN was there to the rescue. User experience improved and that shows off in bounce rate. Visitors are visiting more and more pages. That's all. If you are looking for a CDN solution, you can consider using Max CDN. Its inexpensive, fast, reliable and the most important of all, its completely newbie friendly. Hope my review helps. "

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mike McAlister,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","My experiences with MaxCDN have been great so far. I needed to speed up my WordPress theme demos and the caching plugins I had weren't cutting it anymore. I was able to get MaxCDN hooked up to my demos in one evening with the W3 Total Cache plugin. It has built in MaxCDN support, so it was a breeze. My demos went from a 7 second load time to a 2 second load time overnight. I couldn't be happier with these results and have MaxCDN to thank for this much-needed optimization. "

I plan to stay with this service for a very long time. Highly recommended! I will be posting a more in-depth review (with proof) on my website within the next couple of days."

Use it, its the best way to improve your web site, the search engines and your users will thank you."

X-Cart is not known for speed, but with some common sense and (here's the most important part) getting your images and css and js to the edge servers. Our page load time has been cut by more than half. I am playing with the big boys even though I only have a very solid VPS.  MaxCDN was effortless to configure and there was plenty of support as needed. Can't say enough good about the product and service. One interesting thing is that since all of my images and js is on the edge servers, '0 second visits' have all but been eliminated. Users are usually willing to give you 2 seconds for a page load, but not always 4. With MaxCDN my page loads are all under 2 sec. Happy! "

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Joseph Abdallah,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been a customer of MaxCDN for exactly a year! (I renewed my bandwidth allotment today!). Last year I started to build a lot of WordPress blogs using the multi-user install, after 100 or so blogs I noticed that my server resources were very high, after talking to my host, they offered to lease me another server at quite a considerable cost! I don't like spending money, so I started to read articles about optimizing WordPress and making it faster, after doing all the tweaks to my current server, still I needed a new server or a CDN. I started looking at all the CDN companies out there and MaxCDN came out the cheapest, also there are several plug-ins for WordPress that allow seamless integration. Not only did I save hundreds of dollars on an additional server, my current servers resources are running much lower and allowed me to build more sites! Lastly, because I didn't use my entire bandwidth allocation, a sales rep offered a discount on my subscription, which is saving me even more money! My sites are more reliable, they load faster and I am making more money because I chose MaxCDN! "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Tony Jiang,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN for a year now and I've only got good things to say. First off, MaxCDN's speed is awesome. 3 meg images that usually take more than 800ms to download from my site (which is pretty fast to begin with) now takes an average of 70ms when cached. I have tried a few other CDNs for comparison but they cost an arm and a leg.  Implementation was dead simple. Service is great since they have an online chat in which you can ping a question any time you want. For the price, there simply isn't any better CDN out there.   "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Chris,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I use MaxCDN for my WordPress site, together with w3 total cache. I have tried others but MaxCDN is a lot better than them. It's a lot cheaper (literally 4-8 times cheaper!) and lightening fast. It also compresses the site and all scripts with gzip. The only thing is, it does not have security features. It seems to be a pure cdn. MaxCDN is great, I'm very happy. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Shailendra Mishra,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I run every website I own on WordPress and most content delivery networks are pretty complicated to configure even for WordPress. Where there is a hassle-free plugin for pretty much everything. And there is a plugin for MaxCDN too. It is a 5 minute job to setup MaxCDN for every WordPress website I own. Their pricing structure is damn simple, I only have to decide upon how many terabytes I need to buy, not any other technicalities. MaxCDN is certainly the best for a newbie like me, but the service is not newbie, it is very professional. I can clearly see that my pages load much faster with MaxCDN (even if I am not anywhere near their nearest server location)."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jakobi,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have had nothing but great service and top notch CDN service. Easy to use interface and the help guides are great. There is everything you need to know about how to set this up with WordPress, W3 Total Cache, vBulletin, and more. Since I run a site that has all 3, it was great. They have zones across the world and it saves me tons of bandwidth."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Rolando Cabral,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I spent a lot of time searching for ways to speed up my website. I tried numerous cache solutions like w3tc and other similar applications. One day I posted my problem in one of the forums and somebody replied suggesting to use MaxCDN. At first I was reluctant but since I need to improve my site's user experience, I tried it anyway. They have a money back guarantee. So I tried it. At first I had some issues related to misconfiguration of some things in w3tc but the tech support was very helpful in figuring out the kinks. Eventually I had it running as expected. It definitely improved my site. It was like night and day as far as loading performance. For 39 bucks, this is the best investment I ever made for my site. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Nalinda,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","MaxCDN is really cool. We were amazed about the options they were providing. If you are looking to bump up your WordPress webpage load up through CDN, you cant go wrong with MaxCDN. Also it is quite easy integrate it with WordPress via W3 Cache tool. Great service and super cheap. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Kevin Ouellette,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN to serve thousands of video files for a few years now, and I've had zero problems. They're much cheaper than some competitors, if you take advantage of limited time offers (received via email) they're the cheapest CDN available. The interface is slick and intuitive, although I rarely have to tinker with anything unless I want to purge a file or two. I've never noticed any network problems, and transfers are extremely fast. I liked others a lot, but if you're on any sort of budget at all, MaxCDN is a nearly seamless alternative."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Billy,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN for 3-5 months now and it's been awesome. I'm not tech whiz but implementing MaxCDN on my site was very easy and simple, I find that other companies make it too complicated and the ease of is what won me over. My sites load up quick, and the loads on my server decreased significantly."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mohamed Rias,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","When I was experiencing downtime often and the site loading time was too slow, I heard about MaxCDN and started using it. Now the server load is considerably reduced and site loading speed is good as well. MaxCDN is a must for all websites!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Dan Penning,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN sped my website up from around a 6 second load time to less than a second on average! Crazy fast for cheap.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,LK,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",The speed is good and the price is not expensive. They have an easy-to-use control panel. We have had a great experience using MaxCDN.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jim,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN is a great option for the self-hosted blogger. Its integration with WordPress and the venerable W3 Total Cache plugin is easy-peasy and it works very well.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Seymour,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I use MaxCDN to improve my clients website. Honestly, use it for a good starting price, as a test. I measure time with other websites for my clients websites in India (my server is in Spain) and the loading time has been improved by reducing the time in half! You need something more? Go and test it now!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Richard,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have one word which describes MaxCDN: amazing! I have the typical website that went somewhat successful and I've noticed that the resources of the server were draining so fast. Of course, serving all that js, css, img start made the site really slow to navigate and it was a pain. Fortunately, I've discovered a nice offer from the MaxCDN guys and I gave it a try. Now, I have a really fast site, I just love it! The set up was pretty quick so I can't stop recommending this service to everyone who develop websites with lots of visitors. Give it a try and you will love them too!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Teh Haleunit,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I must say that I was first told about MaxCDN on one of the WordPress blogs that I read regularly. I then carefully dipped my toe in the CDN water with their introductory offer. From what I have seen so far with 3 sites using MaxCDN, page load times have got much faster and my server load has decreased tremendously. I love the dashboard and the ability to handle my push and pull zones. The ease of integrating it into my WordPress caching plugin was a snap and I must say one of the most endearing features of MaxCDN is the online help articles and knowledge base. No stone unturned and I have not needed to ask for support once. It just plain works and works well!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,SunithBabu,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN is the best CDN in the content delivery network platform. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Will,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN provide an excellent platform to use alongside our WordPress hosting. It's so easy to get setup using the W3 Total Cache. They also provide a great origin push platform for getting files out there the fastest. I have used this on a few occasions to publish eBooks we have wrote. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Steven Sashen,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I was really surprised to see how much MaxCDN improved my site speed. And the price is well worth it for us. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Mark Bailey,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","There's a reason MaxCDN is so popular. They offer a great service at very affordable rates. Setup is easy, and support is there if you need them (which we rarely do). We specialize in WordPress, and MaxCDN works beautifully with it. We highly recommend them."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,J.Lee,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have been procrastinating about finding a CDN for my website. So when I finally got around to it, I researched and wanted a company that was reliable and a good deal. Mainly good deal as it seems most CDN companies I found were pretty reliable. So I decided to give MaxCDN a try. The setup instructions were pretty easy and I was up running (vBulletin and WordPress). What really impressed me was that I had some questions regarding my setup a bit and their live chat was awesome. So far my site loads fast and I'm happy with MaxCDN and their support."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Ray Mond,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",One of the fastest and affordable CDN services available today. Setting up is a breeze with 4 different zones to choose and they also support custom SSL (also for an affordable price) which is really great to prevent mixed content. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Peter Hadlaw,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I cannot express more deeply how satisfied I am with MaxCDN. Not only is the service phenomenal, but their customer service is just as superb. Let me share with you a couple points about why I like MaxCDN. First of all I chose MaxCDN because I was looking to decrease page load times and reap the benefits that come with that. Since day 1 I have seen a significant decrease in load times, so significant that my clients (from my professional web design business) commented and complimented the improved speed. This brings me to my second point, MaxCDN is so cheap! It's literally something I activated one night for about 30-40$ plus ~12 per additional domain names and was able to provide not only for my site but my client sites too! The service was so easy to activate because they use a wide range of tools that you can quickly integrate into systems like Drupal, WordPress and others (Drupal is my preferred choice). My last point is that their customer service is so knowledgeable and helpful. I had a couple questions about how I can combine another service of mine and make sure it was compatible and they were able to get into the very technical aspect of it without any delay. They know their stuff and they have a great (while low-priced) product. Try it, I'm happy I did."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Keshab Raj Adhikari,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","Awesome Service, best support and best CDN ever, every site must try."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Giuseppe,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN since last August and I aboslutely love their service. My site is twice as fast, resources are loaded at super speed. Their support service is awesome but you won't need it, their control panel is too easy and user-friendly! I recommend MaxCDN to everyone, whether you have a small site or a popular one, Google (and other search engines) loves speed and CDNs. Your speed will improve your ranking."
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Giannis Goutzamanis,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I have a pull zone in MaxCDN which grabs my images and keeps them in their cache. So simple. They have the best prices with gzip compression which is perfect for me. I am very satisfied with their support. Two times I needed them and they answered very fast and reliable. Five stars from me! 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jaime GM,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I have been using MaxCDN for a while, I have to recognize they are pretty good at what they do. Overall I am happy with the service. Great support team and amazing occasional deals. There are many providers of CDN but for me MaxCDN is the best."

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Tony Greene,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN for nearly 1 year when they were doing a promo in August. In addition to using the service, I combine it with caching to bring my site to a very fast loading and respectable 4 seconds or less. Videos were very easy to follow along to implement on my site as well. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Phill Healey,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",We've recommended and implemented MaxCDN to several of our clients including our own site. In all instances MaxCDN has taken our sites from being fast to super awesome fast. The difference really is astonishing especially where the audience is global. Using MaxCDN has really helped push one of our clients into a prime slot in the market place. If you have any doubts about the value this service can add to a website/online business just do a test on the page and doubt no more!
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Steve,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN is a very reliable choice for bandwidth services and super fast content delivery. They are as great as they seem to be! 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,SpaceClubbing Dancefloor,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've used MaxCDN for about one year, my WordPress site was supercharged. The average speed of my site was 5-6 seconds before using MaxCDN. After implementing MaxCDN the average speed was 1-2.5 seconds loading time. Is very easy to use, they have step by step tutorials so you don't have to be a super engineer to utilize MaxCDN. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Shumail Mohyuddin,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","When it comes to site performance, page load time and content delivery, MaxCDN takes the lead. Excellent CDN service, powerful content delivery network, easy integration with CMS like WordPress or Joomla & all this for very affordable price. The other thing that's great of MaxCDN is their 24/7 support which is amazing. For all those who want to get high on Google and are being ignored due to site performance, they should try MaxCDN. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Eric Ridley,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","A little over one year ago, we migrated all of our websites to MaxCDN, and could not be happier with the results. In addition to the lightning speed, we've never been down since. The people at MaxCDN have always been pleasant to deal with, and have gone out of their way to help us with all our questions (which, as non-techies, have been numerous). My highest recommendation! "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Eric Amundson,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","We love MaxCDN and use it on several WordPress-based sites. Integrating and using MaxCDN is a piece of cake using the W3 Total Cache WordPress plugin. Seriously, the first time I used it, I thought there had to be more setup steps, but no; it's just that easy. Thanks MaxCDN for a great service and terrific customer support!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Adrian A.,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I have been using MaxCDN now for the past 2-3 months. I simply love their service for the sole purpose of doing what they advertise.

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Ali,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN for about an year now and I can't stress it enough for recommendation. It's the way to make your site load at the speed of light. I have around 10 WordPress sites and a few eCommerce sites all of them tightly integrated with MaxCDN. The result is just mind blowing. Do not think twice, just go get yourself an account. They have offers from time to time which you can take advantage of and get your site hooked up!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Chris,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","MaxCDN is awesome! I use it for my Magento powered websites and a few blogs on WordPress. It's great to load my catalogue pictures on my Magento websites from the MaxCDN severs across the globe. You can feel a performance boost both from parallelisation across hostnames and from loading the big picture file from a location that is near to your customer. It's easy to setup and the support is great! If you need it for Magento you can use it with the free extension from onePica. It worth every penny (the prices are very affordable too). Use it, you won't regret!"
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Oscar De Gracia,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",The performance is amazing! I was new to CDN and when I finally got it a friend of mine recommended it. It almost saves me 50% of the load time because I have so many photos on my site. I really love MaxCDN!   
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Sam Smith,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I am very happy with MaxCDN. In fact, I use several and I prefer them for quite a few reasons. It was a very pleasant surprise to see that the support is so efficient and patient. I had to contact them once to integrate my cloudflare setup and the tech not only went back and forth with my questions for like 6-7 emails, but he also gave me point-form instructions, a 1-2-3 type that made it so easy. I don't have many technical details to provide, but I like it because it just works. It does its job well and the help is there if you need it. Its easy to use, and great prices. "

MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Doug B,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013","I've been using MaxCDN for a few months, and they've not missed a beat. My Pingdom results are fast, setup was very quick and easy (to the extent I was suspicious!) and integration with Wordpress is seamless. After struggling with a couple of other providers, I couldn't recommend MaxCDN enough. "
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Thomas Zickell,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",MaxCDN allows for an easy to use dashboard along with an outstanding content delivery network. I have personally seen my site improve speed by over 300%. I would recommend them to anyone that's looking for a content delivery network or just as a slow website. They have excellent support and they are a fantastic company to work with. 
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Maulik Bengali,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",Works like a charm on WordPress with the help of W3 Total Cache.
MaxCDN,www.maxcdn.com,Jason Comely,"Wednesday, January 23, 2013",I've signed up several of my websites with MaxCDN and a number of client websites as well. The performance boost is great and the customer service support was there when I needed it. Highly recommended.

CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Mark,"Thursday, January 15, 2015","We needed a solution to the huge traffic spikes we occasionally receive which were causing our site to crash. I was unsure what a CDN was or how it could benefit us but the CDNify guys were very helpful in explaining the mechanics. The online documentation also made the switch a breeze. We've just had our first major traffic spike since installing and our site handled the hits comfortably."
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,philsallt,"Tuesday, December 23, 2014",I am impressed with the ease with which you can set up a cdn to speed up your website quite considerably. Customer service is excellent. Would recommend these guys & the price is very reasonable
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Blair Thompson,"Tuesday, December 2, 2014",I signed up for CDNify and I am really impressed with how fast my website is now running. I was having trouble setting up a certificate and their support staff helped me out straightaway. The price is good as well. I would really recommend them if you are looking for a CDN.
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Jordan,"Monday, November 24, 2014","The staff at CDNify are respectful, friendly and prompt. The pricing is also great. However, in my opinion, they engage in extremely questionable business practices. I came across CDNify recently when I was investigating alternatives for content distribution on my site. During my discovery process, I looked at 5 different options, CDNify being one of them. In order to determine if a particular provider would be a good fit, I needed to sign up for an account from each provider to determine if it would fit my needs. I signed up for an account with CDNify, quickly did a small amount of testing, determined that it will not be a fit for my needs, and then proceeded to ask for a refund. They refused multiple times. Evidently, it's hidden in their TOS that they ""do not issue refunds."" How else am I supposed to determine if their services will work for what I'm trying to do? All CDNs are NOT created equally! Every other CDN provider I tested/experimented with either offered a refund or offered a free way for me to test out their product. I purchased the 150GB plan and literally used 20mb - all I wanted was a refund for the 99.9999% of the plan that is unused. I realize that the amount of money in question is fairly trivial, but it's the principal of the issue that really bothers me. I will never do business with CDNify again as I cannot trust them to do the right thing."
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Gilles,"Thursday, September 25, 2014","Wow, CDNify is one of the best services i've ever spent my money on!

CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Tamara Zuk,"Tuesday, May 20, 2014","While we're still relatively new to CDNify, I must say their customer service is great. As for their CDN, it is competitively priced and they keep constantly adding new features for the same price :DPlus, you can't beat free SSL support!"
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,James Mulvany,"Wednesday, February 26, 2014","CDNify is great for startups, digital agencies, developers and internet business owners who want to supercharge their website or apps. The way CDNify works, is by distributing your content across a global network of servers, geographically dispersed and then serving that content to the user from the location that is closest to them. This reduces latency for the end user, speeds up your website and also offloads bandwidth from your servers :)"
CDNify,www.cdnify.com,Matt Barton,"Thursday, February 6, 2014","Been using CDNify for a couple of months to power a few of our clients' websites. We've noticed an increase in speed and also have found the service to be reliable - its easy to use, with a good control area."

CMS2CMS,www.cms2cms.com,Brady McCain,"Friday, July 17, 2015","I was trying to migrate from Blogger to Joomla. It seemed like it would be an easy, straight-forward process, but it was far from that. I first contacted support via chat and basically was told that their techs would look into it. I get an email the next day that gives me the same instructions that are on the website as if I didn't already follow them. Their instructions need to be re-written to include the basic info that i had to submit support tickets for.Then when something FINALLY started to work (demo use), I go into the admin of Joomla to find that their software deleted 70 articles from my database! I had to take the website offline and rebuild from a backup for about 3 hours.Their policy is that they don't give refunds unless their techs have a chance to run the migration for you. And why would I let your garbage software ruin my website again?My advice... run the demo BEFORE giving them any money. And for those interested... I imported my Blogger XML file into the EasyBlog component. Then EasyBlog has a plugin that will make copies of your blog posts as articles. Free & done."

CMS2CMS,www.cms2cms.com,Mark Teller,"Friday, July 12, 2013","The migration service is only superficial, so is useless on everything but a plain HTML website. They specifically disclaim themselves from any real responsibility. If you have a problem, there is no refund - just re-read the disclaimer. Hooray for attorneys!"
PageLime,www.pagelime.com,Marco,"Friday, August 26, 2016","We worked with Pagelime about 4 years. In the beginning it worked perfectly. It's an easy wysiwyg CMS, works quite intuitive.When we experienced problems on some sites, we waited many weeks before we got any response. Later we kept on getting a message that there were payment problems, although the subscription was paid for by credit card automatically every month.When we finally decided this wouldn't work anymore, absolutely no reaction from Pagelime. We couldn't stop the automatical withdrawals, so we had to void our credit card. Now, 1,5 year later, we receive a mail that we have to update our 'billing'...Pagelime? Never again!"

Americaneagle.com,www.americaneagle.com,Omar Sanchez,"Monday, October 6, 2014","This outfit isn't exactly bleeding technology. They don't seem to be able to actually do much functionality wise. There are quite a number of more robust, higher ended content manager systems on the market.The support is also insultingly lackluster, for the slightest bit of minimal change or enhancement you can expect to get a hefty pricetag attached to it. Things like minor changes to html (not even actual programming here)."
CSG International,www.csgi.com,beck,"Tuesday, May 6, 2014",This is a great site for any use you may have. My favorite is the backup storage.

Even better, it looked really professional and looked really good on my phone, which is how many of our clients find us. I'll be honest though, if you're looking for custom design, this isn't the right choice for you, just hire a designer. If you just need a site that looks really good really fast, try them out. Probably the best thing is that whenever we needed help we got a response within a few hours, that's hard to beat."
PaperThin,www.paperthin.com,Roland,"Tuesday, December 17, 2013",PaperThin is an amazing content management system. Their service has been easy to utilize and my whole team has learned the ins and outs of it fairly quickly. I would certainly recommend it.
PhraseApp,www.phraseapp.com,feedyoambition,"Friday, January 31, 2014",PhraseApp makes it easier to be a global citizen because it makes translation available within the page.

SkyPrep,www.skyprep.com/,Jack Kammer,"Friday, June 20, 2014","I have been on both sides of the IT tech/user interface. I can enthusiastically and unequivocally say that I have never known an IT operation with a more positive can-do attitude than SkyPrep's. First, they have a stellar platform. But no platform is perfect and there are always features and options that might make it better. In other IT operations -- including the ones I have belonged to -- the attitude on the part of the tech people was very much we/they. ""We (the tech people) know all. And wouldn't this be a great job if it weren't for all those users and customers we have to deal with."" The attitude at SkyPrep is much healthier and ultimately much more constructive for everyone. If you have an idea for a feature, SkyPrep's approach is open-minded and creative. ""Hmmm. Maybe that would be a good idea. And maybe it would be even better if we also did such-and-such..."" I'm not saying the SkyPrep tech people don't have to prioritize and I'm not saying they can drop everything for every request you make, but they seem to think of customers as partners, as scouts for what the training market needs. So if you need more than a cookie cutter approach to a learning platform, I would make two suggestions. Number one, sign up with SkyPrep; most if not all the features you need are probably already there. Number Two, think of yourself as their partner in return by respectfully and appreciatively letting them know what you think would help them in their mission of making SkyPrep even better and better and better. And that's saying a lot."
SkyPrep,www.skyprep.com/,Becky,"Thursday, November 28, 2013","The app is very easy to use even for non-technical people, and allows me to input variety of document types, and videos.

LearnUpon,www.learnupon.com,Tony Fitzpatrick,"Wednesday, August 28, 2013","As a training company we have used and reviewed a number of LMSs, and non fitted our needs better than LearnUpon. The key benefits for us was the ability to get up and running quickly with the tools to share and reuse our SCORM courses across multiple clients with little fuss. We have been using the system for a number of months and are delighted with ease of use of the application. Finally while Learnupon has exceeded our expectations as a learning platform, we have been blown away by the level of support and responsiveness of the Learnupon team - keep up the good work guys.!"
LearnUpon,www.learnupon.com,Mark Williams,"Wednesday, August 21, 2013","LearnUpon has been amazing for us, we have a staff of approx. 250 employees and we setup and deployed our training within literally days of creating our account. We had a set of SCORM courses to import which was very easy to do and it just worked. We have very little support showing just how easy it has been to use and setup and the team at LearnUpon are amazingly helpful with their advice on how we can grow our internal training online. Thank you guys, loving our LearnUpon portal and the application as a whole!"

Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Shay King,"Monday, February 22, 2016","I would never recommend this company, I signed up with a deal listed by them over on WHT and after waiting 14 hours for the service to be activated I submitted a support ticket. After activation of the VPS, cPanel was not installed which was included as part of the offer. After contacting support backwards and forwards cPanel was finally installed however not licensed. After another support ticket I was told to wait for admin to activate it. During all this the server was encountering issues with MySQL and the firewall blocking all connections to WHM. I gave up waiting cPanel activation and requested a cancellation after 48 hours of support tickets where the service agent had no clue or authority to help the customer, I then had to wait a further 48 hours and a PayPal claim to get refunded. What ever you do don't go through this company."

Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Justin B,"Wednesday, March 12, 2014","I was with Host NIT for one and a half year and they've had moments of downtime, but overall they have been the best company I've been with so far. I have 2 products: a shared hosting plan for my personal blog and I have a VPS plan for my hosting company. Before I posted my review I saw some of the previous posts and I'd put my money that Host NIT would never that way. From owning a hosting company myself, this is a very sad fact but guess what? People Lie! Back to my review: They own up to their mistakes and make sure you are comfortable with them. I'm hoping to get a Dedicated server in about 2 months. Keep up the wonderful work!"
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,travellerw,"Monday, January 20, 2014",It appears this company has taken a turn for the worse. Their support is awful. Look elsewhere unless you want your stuff down for days.

Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Kim Ravers,"Friday, July 5, 2013","My review will be short and brief. I was recommended to Host NIT from a friend, at first I was a bit skeptical because we house about 10 active servers. Needless to say I ended up switching all 10 servers and now I've managed to save my company over $5xx.xx a month. We have un-manged services so we don't deal with there support staff a lot. We only deal with them when we need an rDNS update or to upgrade services etc. They are very prompt and respond quickly. Keep up the good work Host NIT!"
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Mike Semor,"Friday, July 5, 2013","I was searching online for a better web hosting company, my previous host was terrible it took them 3 hours to answer a support ticket and days to resolve issues. Although this was the first time hearing about  Host NIT, as a result of the courteous response I received over chat and phone I decided to give them a try. My company requires 3 dedicated servers to run efficiently, at least that's what I was doing with my previous Host. I took a High Powered server from Host NIT and it solved all my needs and saved our clinic a few hundred dollars ; the specs of one server surpasses the previous three I-7 CPU chipset I was working with before.  Thank you Host NIT, you are the best!"
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Alex,"Tuesday, June 4, 2013",Great service. Always improving. Strongly recommended hosting company. The support team stand with you at every step of the service.

Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Jason Hassan,"Wednesday, April 17, 2013","I was with cpanelhosting since 2011 and my time there was horrible until Host NIT took over the company. I was stuck because I paid for 2 years upfront. And I was just about to leave then I got an email saying that the company was sold. I then told myself I should at least give it a try and I'm really glad I did. They actually responded to my support requests, my website wasn't down anymore. I was very thankful. Host NIT has been great to me and I've recommend this company to all my friends that need hosting.  "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Alexis Romeo,"Tuesday, April 16, 2013","I run a franchise for an accounting company and its imperative that my corporation's website stays up, plus all of the franchise under me. We're talking about over 500 locations in NY alone and we have locations all over the US. Its about 10,00   websites under the main Corp. Host NIT has been there for me every step of the way. I call at 3am in the morning and someone would help me. This Company is nothing but awesome! I really couldn't describe it better. Great support, pretty much no downtime, very friendly staff. What else could you ask for? I've been with them for a year and I actually just renewed for 3 years before I did this review. All I have left to say is, give them a try - you wont find a better company. "

I wont name names but they are all listed on this website. I have a very expensive VPS from Host NIT - I didn't start that way but I just needed the resources and kept upgrading. They made it very easy to do so. Their support is on point and i wish I just found Host NIT before all the others, I would have saved so much money. I love the affiliate program because it pays my hosting bill and I get paid every month! Host NIT is highly recommended by me. "

I have un-managed VPS services from them and I decided to ask if they could help out. Can you believe they installed this for me absolutely free of charge?! And it was done in just an hour. I've had them for 3 years now and this is literally my 2nd time contacting support. Highly recommended to anyone that needs a VPS, or any other products for that matter. "

They give so many reasons, until an email said my account can be accessed but then another email said my account is not registered to Host NIT. Till today I still have login details to my Host NIT account but unfortunately my VPS is dead. "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Jessica Vassell,"Monday, April 15, 2013","I was with a web hosting company for 6 months under a plan that I thought that I needed. When I requested a quote with Host NIT I found out my hosting company been ripping me off. After hearing what Host NIT could offer me for less, I took the representatives word for it on the 30 day money back guarantee and signed up. Ill tell you they met my expectations. These guys were able to put me on a plan that suited my needs for an affordable price. If you want an honest reliable web company these guys can definitely help."
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Jackob Pierre,"Monday, April 15, 2013","I just have a say I've had a great year with them so far and the support is out-standing! 5 Stars all the way. I mean I started off knowing nothing, then used a website builder to create a nice website. Now I'm a very successful hosting reseller. "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Jack AmaduA,"Monday, April 15, 2013","I have 3 dedicated servers with them and overall I am very happy with the services provided. My servers are managed and I'm still learning how to really use cpanel and all the functions and commands. The great thing about having a managed server is that whatever tickets my customers send to me, if I don't know the answer I just ask Host NIT and I get an answer right away. All I can really add to that is keep up the good work and thank you for always being there for me. I would recommend this company to anyone! "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Cassandra White,"Monday, April 15, 2013","I am new to the web hosting thing, my sisters and I came up with the idea of having our own family website online last July. Well after hours looking for a company that would help us newbies at a great price I came to their link. The gentlemen that was answering my question that night helped me a great deal. We were going with the support tickets back and forth, he didn't seem to be bothered. I ended up signing up for the shared hosting plan, best of all I didn't have to pay to have nobody designing my site. They have this thing called site builder. My family got together with the help of the kids and we had our site up and running. Host NIT is a good company with well mannered staff. A few companies quote me before them and seem like they were only interested in making a sale. Im glad I chose them. "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Mike Nicols,"Monday, April 15, 2013","This is going to be a bit of a long review but I want to explain everything. Currently I have 5 of their services. 1 Shared Plan that I use for personal, 2 VPS for a non-profit organization and for a Hosting Company I'm starting, and finally a reseller plan so all my nephews can create their own sites. I started off with them about 1 year ago after switching from multiple hosts. I was so thankful I could finally get a home for my projects. There are a few major differences from my personal experience with the other companies I was with and Host NIT: The flexibility of server software, flexibility of pricing - I got a good discount for my non-profit org, the support was always there no matter what the question or what the time was. The last 3 months I did have some problems on my reseller account - they told me the hard drive I was on crashed or was damaged, but they did have a backup of my sites so it really wasn't an issue. The problem was the settings in WHM wasn't the same and I just couldn't figure it out. I did have a bit of downtime with the hard drive replacement - it was for about 30 minutes or so. I'm giving this company 5 stars because of several reasons. 1. Their support staff is very friendly and fixes everything - they do way more than they are supposed to do for me. 2. The company is always finding new ways to improve and I think that's how a company should be. 3. The prices are unbeatable and the great thing is (i hope I'm allowed to say this) they will customize a plan for you if you don't find one on the site that fits you. 4. My final reason is Growth: I started off with just a 2 dollar plan and now I have 5 different services and I can choose to upgrade those services at anytime - I don't feel limited in any way whatsoever and this goes for all my plans with them. In my opinion if you're looking for a home for your needs, I would highly recommend them."
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Anuj,"Tuesday, April 9, 2013",I have been with HostNit for more than 2 years. It had been a good experience. But for the last couple of months the service is not good and the the technical support quality had decreased. I hope they will recover from this soon.
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Mike Noxaura,"Monday, April 8, 2013","I've been a reseller for about a year and a half, and been with Host NIT for about 7 months now. Their tech support has been nothing short of spectacular, the system has only glitched once and only for a few minutes (which is a hell of a lot better than I can say for certain brit companies!). The speed of loading for my clients has been received well. If you're looking for a reseller package or VPS, you would do well to work with Host NIT."
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Nicky Lee,"Monday, April 8, 2013","I've been with Host NIT a few months and like all the others have said great support and cheap prices for great services.

Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Mark,"Friday, April 5, 2013","I have a VPS server with this company and I was amazingly surprised to see how they have improved their services after the recent Servers upgrade. Their prices are fair compared to the other hosting companies out there. The staff members are friendly and eager to help. Support is available through email, chat and by phone anytime of day. I'll vote them the best hosting company. "
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Rich Davids,"Thursday, April 4, 2013",I have several shared hosting websites with them and I've been with them for about 5 months. I really love the price and when you need help they are there for you.
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Tony Rivera,"Thursday, April 4, 2013","I've been with Host NIT from the start and they are always improving their service. I started out with a reseller and then moved up to a VPS plan, which I love and recommend to any resellers out there. The best thing about it is that any question I have, no matter how stupid it may be, they help me and got the problem resolved. I've recommended this company to several friends and I'm earning money for it! My hosting pretty much pays for itself. Keep up the good work guys."
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Andy Pierre,"Wednesday, April 3, 2013",I have been with HostNIT for years. They have been good to me and all my clients. Great uptime and outstanding support. Their service is prompt since they rotate technicians and those guys are knowledgeable too. If you ask me this is the place to be.
Host NIT,www.cpanelhosting.com,Rbrt Groves,"Wednesday, April 3, 2013","In June of 2010, after an emergency with my previous host, I moved my hosting business to HostNIT. Being an emergency move, I was only planning on being with them until I could review other options and put a permanent plan in place. I have remained with them since that time because their server status is consistent, their tech support is top notch, and the owner is genuinely concerned that everyone finds their experience satisfactory. I frequently contact tech support with questions and requests and have found their response times absolutely amazing. Recently, I requested a site transfer into my reseller account and while I was prepared for a few hours or more turn time, customer support had it completed just over 30 minutes. Anyone just starting to get into web hosting would benefit greatly from HostNIT's expertise and helpfulness. As well, anyone who has been in web hosting for the long term would certainly see the benefits HostNIT provides. I am 100% satisfied!"

After reviewing several web based CRM solutions we selected Commence based on the companys impressive track record, strong customer references and two product features that seem to differentiate Commence from the pack. First, the user interface was by far the best we had seen and the easiest to use. Second, the products ability to enable us to see a complete 360-degree customer profile on one screen was critically important. There is no scrolling or jumping from page to page making the user experience much better. We are quite pleased with our decision.

I have now added the customer service application which we had planned from the start but held off until we were satisfied with Commence. The application is good and fully integrated with the rest of the CRM applications. Its also considerably less expensive than competitive offerings. It does not have a customer portal but Commence says that will be available in 2013.     "

When I really prioritized what's important to get from a CRM, OnePage was my final choice.Its easy to configure to the way in which you do business.  It has a very user-friendly, uncomplicated interface.  (Otherwise, who would want to use it?!)  It has a totally useful mobile interface, and most importantly, lets you focus on moving your prospects through to closure.  (And then lets you stay in touch!)

The bottom-line is that Pipeliner is the best combination of functionality, usability and value available in the market.We were looking for an app that could handle three key major feature categories account/relationship modeling, visual pipeline display and marketing application integration. It seems like a simple set of requirements, but we found it amazingly hard to get all of these things working well in most packages."

Practically everything is wizard-guided, but in a way that doesn't become pedant the third time you use it. Or the 300th, for that matter.Second, their support guys are very responsive, kind, and competent. Even for low-cost accounts.Last but in no way least: Automations! As a professional software developer I always appreciate being able to customize something with code, but ActiveCampaign took this a giant step forward with their visual editor. One of the best UI's ever! By combining Automations, contact tagging, and a bit of creativity, there's really very little you can't do."

RealtyJuggler,www.realtyjuggler.com,Devorah Alden ,"Friday, July 17, 2015","In the interests of full disclosure, I am an agent assistant.  I've used other CRMs in the past, so I think I can give you a pretty good evaluation of RealtyJuggler.  To start off with, it is the least expensive of any of the full featured CRM products for Real Estate.  It runs in a browser window, and works with any browser.  I use RealtyJuggler with Chrome on my work computer and the regular Safari browser on my iPad.  We sync RealtyJuggler with a Gmail account that we both have access to, which makes it easy to keep a unified Contact list, as well as keeping the Calendar / appointments up to date.  When we were looking to switch from a more expensive CRM, RealtyJuggler was an easy one to try as they have a 90 day free trial.  It was easy to get started thanks to the built-in video training, as well as their amazing technical support.   I think my favorite features are how easy they made it to follow up with clients, as well as the way website leads flow automatically into RealtyJuggler, so no re-typing or copy and paste from emails."
Tribus,www.tribusgroup.com,Walter Roller,"Wednesday, April 23, 2014","Tribus claims that its new CRM v3 integrates automatically IDX Broker data into the database and several hundred real estate agents use it in conjunction with IDX Broker.  Since 2/18/2014, when we signed up for CRM3, Tribus has not been able to establish a single connection to IDX Broker, not a single update in any field! They have imported over 700 of our leads via CSV list into Our new database. The new database has been dormant since. In now 65 days not the simplest tasks have been accomplished so far  none of our contacts who signed up on IDX Broker had been added, nor have the boxes for saved searches, product updates any data in them. Literally no activities on our website (Google tracking) NOT ANYTHING has been automatically added to the database. But that is exactly what Tribus promises and the reason we signed up. Just for reference we have added 117 leads during that time on IDX Broker.After many contacts by mail and phone it appears the Tribus customer support and technicians do not  have any idea if, when and how the program will auto populate the fields from equivalent fields in IDX Broker.  So for 2 month the CMR system has been sitting dead.Any real estate agents out there who work with IDX Broker and Tribus who gets actual data imported to the CRM3?

Genesys,www.genesyslab.com,Membership Drive,"Friday, July 31, 2015","We were promised quite a few features, including Salesforce integration, that were in the specs we agreed to when we agree to a price. Those features were never created, and when we asked for them for over a year we were finally told that we could get them if we paid far more money. When sharing the documents they had created that promised these features, we were stonewalled, offered no concessions, and were treated horribly.  Our experience with Genesys is that the system is overly complicated compared to competitors like Fonality, is unfriendly to users, many of the staff are technically incapable, and they don't deliver what they promise. They were a waste of money, and extremely disappointing. "

We are easily able to look up our clients, see what tickets are out there for them, both open and closed, and make modifications. Even if a ticket has been closed, someone else can re-open that ticket (as long as they have security access) and add additional notes or provide feedback. The 'Visible to Customers' option is nice because if you want to keep your customers in the loop as to what is going on with that ticket, you can check that. If not, they will not see your comments, but will get a notification when the case has been resolved and the ticket has been closed. I would highly recommend Team Support to anyone! Great product!"

I installed WordPress and transferred all of my files over so easily and my site ran a lot faster (duh, old host was free).

I can manage nearly everything. If there is a missing feature in control panel I can request it and it will be added. Wow.They seem to be online 24/7 and are ready to help  with everything. Pricing is a bit higher than some of the cheaper hosts, but I would definitely consider it well priced for what your getting.I can also add that Aspnix is known as a windows specialized host, but I transferred by wordpress site from a linux host and was happy to see performance increased which I couldn't believe at first. It's due to the fact that they have certified PHP/MySQL developer specifically for windows systems! And of course they are a Good web host for asp.net apps as well.Check out their TeamSpeak VoIP services as well if you're into gaming.I like it and highly recommend."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Ovunc,"Friday, March 14, 2014","They provide very good service. Their software is always up to date. They continuously implement new features to their hosting panel. When you have a question, their live support service wait for you. You can also select datacenter location when you order. Just give them a change and you won't regret it."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Brian Almeida,"Tuesday, March 11, 2014","Been through several  TeamSpeak providers in the past 4 years... I can say ASPnix is a p.e.r.f.e.c.t provider. TeamSpeak quality is amazing, the best I have had thus far. No latency issues, they allow all codecs, it really is just good service. I just started a Windows web hosting account with them as well and moved our clan site from a free web hosting provider. So far everything is A-OK here too! Very happy clan and a happy clan leader to have finally found a good home to stay!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Cihan,"Monday, March 10, 2014","I have been with ASPNIX for around 5 years. But I ended up cancelling my account. It was good customer relationship at the beginning but after 2010-2011 it has changed. They are usually mean and when you ask for something you feel guilty to get help! These guys are really losing it now, i see some of my friends posting on facebook about their frustration at aspnix and how bad their services are. Here is a little story from last year, i wanted cancel my account that is never in use for a long while. Why pay for an account you never use? I also had a free one month service from them to make up for a long long downtime in the year before( my websites were down for a week, yes you heard right, for a one bloody week. They offered me one month free hosting to make up for it). Like couple weeks before my hosting service finishes, i realized they have charged me for 'Hosting renewal"". I contacted them and asked why they have charged me before the service end day and ask for a return as i am not using it anymore. But they didint cancel and return my money and said i missed the due date even though my service end date was different. So i had to pay whole year's money for nothing. There are couple of stories like this only from myself. I can imagine what other people dealing with. Also, there is a person called Chris York, the worst customer support I have ever seen in my life. I am so disappointed and will never advise any of my industry friends to work with these guys. If you want to have at least average customer service and support, don't work with these guys.  "
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Paul Brooks,"Tuesday, November 12, 2013","I've been using several web hosts for some years now but lately found my sites were getting more and more sluggish, so I started looking around for a new host. Having done Google search I found Aspnix.com, looked at their homepage (it looked professionally designed) and found out they offered affordable hosting plans. On the account of the fact I decided to contact them directly. They offered me a good hosting solution for my needs. Special requests have always come through quickly and gracefully. Uptime since we moved has been 100% and the server is always fast and stable. Their package prices also amazed me. Very professional in approach and follow up. Recommended!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Eric,"Monday, August 19, 2013","Want good website performance for only a few months? Signup with ASPnix. Then after that, all down hill from here. Unless you like your website running like trash, signup with someone else. I've cancelled and moved on."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Jason Nelson,"Friday, August 9, 2013","Signed up for their Teamspeak services a month ago and I am very impressed so far for what seems like a small provider. High quality Teamspeak offerings, decent control panel, very good latency and very nice control over my server. Pricing is excellent too for what you get!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Antonio Marcuqis,"Thursday, August 8, 2013","I've had a VPS with ASPnix for almost a year, was really nice, had no issues, never any downtime (unless scheduled). I really was happy. Then about maybe a month or so ago the happiness ended, apparently my VPS was moved to another server, which would be fine if oh I dunno, I was told about it. It was down without telling me for nearly 2 hours. I spoke with support and they told me it was being moved to a better server. I was upset, but I sucked it up. The move completed, VPS came back online, however none of my services started. I logged into the VPS and WOW! It took nearly 10 minutes (not exaggerating) just to login. The reason my services were not running is because they timed out. Ever since they moved me to HV01, the service has SUCKED. 8-8-2013 - My VPS went ""paused"" today. No notice, no warning, nothing. I could not resume it from the control panel. I contacted support was told it was a host issue. My VPS came back online, however like before, stalled services, VPS responds poorly etc. I installed some software on the VPS today after testing locally on my local Hyper-V setup, and it completed no issues. After getting it uploaded to my VPS it took nearly 20 minutes to install. What took 3 - 5 minutes locally, took 20 minutes on their ""Better"" server. Very upset."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Robert,"Monday, July 22, 2013","Everything was alright up until about a week and a half ago, it all went down hill. Timeouts, disconnections, websites not loading or only halfway loading, clients calling me furious that Outlook is not able to connect to the mail server to get email, they cannot send email, clients are calling my clients asking why their site is not loading etc. I've contacted them about this NUMEROUS times, they say they are working on it, meanwhile it is not getting any better. They don't seem to concerned about how it is affecting me and my customers. Back to my old provider that still uses ancient technology, oh well, at least sites load and emails work."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Arslan Buyuk,"Monday, July 8, 2013","I looked online for reviews of ASPnix.com and found only positive reviews which I thought was fishy since it was too good to be true. Anyway, I went ahead and bought a hosting account. They are customer oriented people and also they know what they do technical wise. They upgraded the quality of my server without raising my prices! It's much faster! Currently extremely happy - they have already saved me hours of hassle, and they supply some very useful scripts. I hope this is the beginning of a beautiful relationship."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Vojtech Sykora,"Wednesday, June 26, 2013","I can say that ASPnix is an honest, reliable and reputable host that goes above and beyond in support of customer needs. Support response times are also another major factor. I get a response in less than 10 minutes on average, from a competent person who actually knows what they are doing. They deliver a genuine focus on problem-solving. I have found the team at ASPnix listens to my requirements, understands online technology platforms and will recommend clever new approaches for solutions that can save me money. The speeds I am experiencing are awesome. Uptime in the 1 year since I moved has been great and the server is always fast and stable. Very professional in approach and follow up. Perfect experience here!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Jaxon Benn,"Wednesday, June 12, 2013","I find ASPnix to be fantastic. Indeed, they have exceeded all my expectations, taking time to answer each of my questions diligently and intelligently, and have a great staff. I raised lots of tickets as I had never moved hosts before and needed some help. Not once I was treated like idiot and always felt I could go back and ask more questions if I had to. They were polite and explained and helped me with everything. The techs contact me checking to see if I have any issues just to be on the safe side. I can add that they have flexible attitude toward hosting. Their network uptime is as promised - 99.99%, it's a great plus for them. Overall, I am quite satisfied with the service they provide and can highly recommend them to other webmasters."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,R. Mattew,"Thursday, May 30, 2013","In June I moved all my scripts, web applications and web sites to Aspnix.com. So I would like to say few words about the process and how everything was: Migration. Was really easy for me -  I provided my old host details and they moved and setup everything for me. Fantastic! Time being. So far I have no problems with my account at all. I do pay every bill in time and get what I need, get the help from their stuff when I need. Uptime. I have seen a lot of people here prefer to tell other about uptime. I do not use any monitoring tools, but I'm sure that is high. Never seen my site down. Thanks. Good host to stay with! "
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Steve,"Friday, May 17, 2013","I have had several websites hosted with various companies in the past, most have been positive experiences.  Been with ASPnix for two years now and am very pleased.  They provide a feature rich product, competitive pricing and good service.  "
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Thomas,"Friday, May 17, 2013","I've noticed a few bad reviews below about their Linux hosting. While I am not on their Linux hosting services, I have been on their Windows services for 4 years now without any big issues. Every time I contact them for whatever reason I get the issue resolved within 30 minutes or so. I appreciate their dedication to making sure I always have the latest toys to play with! The Helm migration was pretty crazy, but after about a week I got used to the new system and I must say, I love it! Thanks ASPnix!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,al,"Monday, May 13, 2013",Only 2 days to look at a problem and cant access databases on cpanel. Why pay for a service that doesn't work. Beware of the support on the Linux accounts as they are labeled contact by email only. All others you can contact someone on the chat system asap. Unacceptable. Will be moving to new hosting this week due to constant issues with this 2 person hosting provider.
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Tj,"Friday, May 10, 2013",Very poor service. If anything fails they always log in and it's fixed and they say nothing was ever wrong. Amazing. Be prepared if your on Linux to have very little support and at least a new issue every month. Do yourself a favor and go to someone else.

Had issues with the previous 2 hosts with my .net apps not working correctly, strange errors, lost support etc. ASPnix seems to be on-top-of-their-game, I get straight answers when I contact support. They are super sharp when it comes to answering my questions and they always have the right answer. Hope I have a home with these guys for a long, long time!"
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Pablo Remindor,"Wednesday, March 20, 2013","I've tried many windows web hosts, but can say that finally I found the best place. It is Aspnix web host. I contacted their support and they were responsive and found the best solution for my needs. Well worth every penny.  The support you receive is excellent no matter what time of day you get in touch. There is always a prompt response to any query.I'm not the most technologically independent person, and of course as soon as I registered, I had questions and they explained to me everything I needed to know. The Web-control panel features are excellent.Pricing is excellent and the servers don't seem overloaded. The quality of the hosting is very good due to the great uptime, fast servers and helpful customer support. I've finally found a good home with aspnix and can highly recommend them. I will continue doing business with them."
ASPnix,www.aspnix.com,Scott,"Friday, March 15, 2013","I did not rate them 5 stars because I believe every company can improve! Technology changes quickly in our industry, being a programmer (.net) I am constantly aware of the changes, and so is ASPnix! .Net 4.0 and 4.5 were rolled out the day or so of the .net 4.x releases! SmarterMail is kept on the bleeding edge of the latest release (my other provider is still on v5). I've been slowly moving my customers to ASPnix, their control panel is easy to use, quick and has tons of options. The package configuration is amazing and the integration with WHMCS is amazing! The ASPnix team are always there to answer my questions, they are prompt and straight to the point. Love it! They have themselves a customer for a long, long, long time!"

ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,Thomas Swan,"Tuesday, September 13, 2016","I have been with ASPhostpotal for a little over 5 years and I believe it's the absolute best. The uptime for the website is nearly 100%, customer services is open 24/7 and they usually assist you within 10 minutes. As well, the control panel you're provide with is so simple that if you don't know anything about the web, they will help you, literally. Pricing is decent for startups looking for a reliable and affordable hosting provider. I would recommend ASPhostportal to anyone that needs hosting for their website."
ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,Roy Moreau,"Thursday, January 14, 2016","Your overall product offering is first class. Having worked many years ago as a Product Manager for one company, I have some understanding of the issues facing companies that offer such nebulous products as Web Hosting. ASPHostPortal Hosting was recommended to me by a web developer, as we had had a few issues with our previous Hosting supplier. He didn't oversell ASPHostPortal to us: he just said that he didn't have any problems and that you guys were ""responsive"". Probably the biggest failure in the web hosting provider sector, is its non-responsiveness. Where ASPHostPortal Hosting differentiates itself from many other companies, is in its responsiveness to customers' Support requests and their timely resolution. In my experience, this is uncommon, especially in the IT sector, which usually ""hates"" providing customer support, preferring to build new infrastructure and other ""more interesting"" things.ASPHostPortal Hosting shows the business maturity to understand that its business *exists* for a customer and acts accordingly. This is one customer who applauds your Service and is very happy to refer you to those looking for a first class, customer-focused Web Hosting provider.Best wishes and thanks again."
ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,David Winterburn,"Thursday, December 10, 2015","I have been a customer of ASPHostPortal for many years now, with them hosting quite a few of my own business and some client business sites that I administrate. The general services offered are great - the performance and uptime being fantastic and this should not go unmentioned. However, I have been driven to comment on this occasion because of, in my opinion, the unsurpassed service provided by the team at ASPHostPortal Support.I will be more specific about their services:The first is their sales team. With one exception they have been friendly, professional and more than ready to make sure the service I receive is second to none. They have never tried to hard sell me anything but they do sometimes make valid and helpful suggestions which, on the occasions I have taken them up, proved to be very worthwhile. I never feel 'conned' or 'pushed'.The second is support team. Unlike the 'support' provided by many of the hosting companies I have used in the past...these people actually get back to you promptly with HELPUL answers that 'normal people' can understand and work with. So many times (with other companies) I have waited ages for a reply to my support only to receive a one liner that required me to take a three year residential course in computer science to decipher, I would then need to wait ages again for a response to my request of...'English please'? If ASPHostPortal can do it, why can't others? In these days where the reputation of customers services as difficult to get hold of, it's refreshing to be proved wrong. Thank you ASPHostPortal."
ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,Lawrence Milburn,"Monday, September 21, 2015",Asphostportal is a great company to work with. My wife and I have been dealing with Asphostportal for several years now and have had nothing less than an outstanding experience. The company we dealt with before Asphostportal had horrible service and lots of issues (which was the reason we decided to switch). Thanks Asphostportal for your wonderful support. Being a novice user I was able to host my E-commerce site in a professional manner. Its possible only because of the handy solutions available at Asphostportal control panel and the support persons at Asphostportal.
ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,Tony Smith,"Friday, August 7, 2015","First of all I was using the services of another hosting provider, I do not want to disclose the name but I was facing the problem of frequent downtimes, so I decided to change my provider. Then someone suggest me to go for ASPHostPortal. I also go through the reviews of ASPHostPortal, they were good and reliable. So, I thought I should try at once and to give them a shot. I like to tell you that when I purchased their web hosting plan on the same day account was set up for me very quickly and constant update e-mails are received by me. But the thing which impressed me a lot of ASPHostPortal was that they have transfer my entire files backup from my old provider to theirs. They face some issues also while doing this, but they are really active and really helpful. When it was done, I went to my old web host without any problem and exported my other 5 databases, and imported to ASPHostPortal with no problem. Another good thing is that this is very fast too. If I remember my old web host then it constantly shows the problems of down alerts, very slow loading of pages, slow ping times, even with Cloud flare and site caching. I would recommend you all ASPHostPortal. It is cheap with excellent features offered as well as with good customer support who give you right answers for all your queries."
ASPHostPortal,www.asphostportal.com/,Marilyn O'Neill,"Wednesday, July 29, 2015","Terrible host, check recent reviews.  On 20 July 2015 our database and website files were apparently deleted due to a hack on the server we hosted using their services.  They advertise state of the art data centers which would be presumed to include the most basic offsite backup to protect data.  They did not do this and we have lost 10 years of data.  Their customer service in the wake of this disaster has been unconscionable.  They have failed to respond to direct questions, suggested blog posts to try to recover our data ourselves, communicated poorly and never contacted clients proactively about their massive failure.  They have provided no credible recovery services and left us losing significant time and money daily without regard whilst complaining about their ""sleepless nights"" and how ""they didn't intend for this"".  They had one job and had they implemented the most minimal back up processes (not keeping backups on the same server for a start) requisite in their industry they would have prevented substantial client losses.  Their lack of assumption of responsibility and astonishingly unprofessional customer service has made this impossible situation even more frustrating as indicated by plenty of reviews of their performance since 20 July 2015 from many similarly impacted clients.

ChicagoVPS,www.ChicagoVPS.net,Jared,"Monday, March 18, 2013","What horrible company. November 2012 came and they got hacked but they lied and said it was an exploit in there VPS software which was proved false later in a community forum. I was one of the 1,000 or more customers who had everything deleted. Luckily it wasn't a very important site and I had recent backups. Okay, upset at the fact they lied and I had to find the truth via other means, but I figured things will get better. Things were okay for a while, its a cheap VPS so quality is not great anyway. And then I was surprised once again, when they got hacked again. I got an email saying I should change my root password and it was part of a 'security measure', all lies. I found a few days later a post where someone released the entire database with all the customers names, email addresses, root passwords, ips, etc. This is very bad and this is not what ChicagoVPS told customers. They lied once again. Turns out that the database was from the November hack and they still try to hush the issue. After downplaying the large database leak of all personal information a couple weeks later I got an email from LastPass, the password management company, saying that they are aware that ChicagoVPS got hacked and that I should update all passwords that I had on file with them as they're not safe. When this was made public a lot of very upset ChicagoVPS customers said they got that email too. But never any email from the company itself to warn them. ChicagoVPS didn't even warn all their customers that their data got hacked. I will never ever trust ChicagoVPS again."

Whenever I need help with something, whether that's remote hands, help while I'm at the datacenter, or even just getting technical advice, Fortrust is always courteous and prompt. I have made the comment many times to my co-workers that I wish customer support at my other datacenters was on-par with Fortrust. In colocation, it's the small things that matter, and Fortrust does this very well. Recently we had one of our firewalls fail on us. Fortrust noticed the outage, and immediately called me to let me know they saw a link-loss on one of our network drops. I received the call even before my own alerts went off. Because of their outreach, we had the machine up and running in a matter of minutes. It's customer service like this that keeps us incredibly happy as customers. Overall, I can't recommend Fortrust enough. Everytime I deal with them, be it over the phone, through email or visiting the Denver facility, it's always a very positive experience. If you're looking for a datacenter that truly cares about you, and does their best to keep you and your servers happy, definitely get in touch with Fortrust."

Now my website is not even built yet and I have one index and graphic with no links and a 2nd page with one 2 minute 6MB mp3. For the last week I have been testing the counts and the data flow.

Powernoodle,www.powernoodle.com,Michael Randel,"Tuesday, October 22, 2013","I have been using Powernoodle since May 2012 in a wide variety of settings to support Collaboration.  It's the best tool I've discovered to support collaboration in all its forms - sharing ideas/brainstorming, processing the ideas, voting and decision-making, and even action planning. All contributions are anonymous, and this is a really powerful feature, as it helps to build trust in groups where that may not exist.  But the process and its reports are fully transparent, so participants can check for themselves that all the comments and votes are accounted for. I use this tool for both synchronous and asynchronous meetings, with small groups and large meetings, to quickly collect and process ideas and feedback. As a cloud-based service, my clients like that they can access meetings from anywhere, whether using a desktop, laptop , tablet or smartphone.  With no software to install, participation is quick and easy. Finally, the team at Powernoodle Inc. are friendly and helpful, always ready to answer your questions and guide you in getting the most from the tool."

But so far, everything has been great. Thanks guys!"

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Johny Garcia,"Tuesday, February 10, 2015","Great support.I have had very few problems with these guys. a few minor mistakes but they were always dealt with well.Their control panel system is absolutely fantastic. it is all redesigned CPanel functions in their own simplistic interface. they have reduced all the Webmail clients down to a single perfect client.... a really professional job.Gigapros gets a 9 out of 10 from me. Impeccable support, yes on weekends too, fast servers and very well priced. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Zakiy Nabil Abadi,"Friday, February 6, 2015","Gigapros service is excellent and I pay for the plan I use about $100 per year. I've had questions that were answered and fixed within minutes, and complex problems worked on by the hosting admins personally resolved in only a couple days. They have live chat to help if you get stuck. and they seem to be available almost all the time.They have great plans and lots of server features. Their plans' capacity might not be amazingly huge, but it's reasonable and fair. I just wish every company I've deal with on a daily basis are as quick and professional as they are, alas many don't come even close... however, at least I know that my website hosting is secured for years to come!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Claudia Monnier,"Monday, February 2, 2015","I am really satisfied dealing with gigapros.com web host. There is no need to worry about their services, they offer 30-day money back guarantee. I like their uptime and also useful tools, for instance, Product Finder - their innovative product finder chart will help find the right product for the web hosting needs. They're really helpful and they value their customer.. They do not farm out telephone support overseas, you can get a knowledgeable rep on the line for real-time chat or very responsive email support. And great prices too. Highly recommended."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,James L. Powell,"Tuesday, January 27, 2015","I like gigapros.com hosting. They have been a pleasure to work with. The customer support and knowledgebase is outstanding. It places high value on customer support and it shows. They've always had excellent support. Top of the line. Their features can't be beat (basically, you can do anything you'd ever need to do).Their pricing is also extremely fair, especially when considering their reliability.They're servers are reliable and fast for their 'shared' hosting classification (dedicated/virtual would be a lot faster), and overall everything works great."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Alex Nekrasov,"Wednesday, January 21, 2015","I totally recommend Gigapros to anyone who would like to set up a website. As a beginner, I look forward to using their more advanced features, which I plan to learn about through their tutorial video library. The services and features Gigapros offers to a user like myself cannot be beat. I find their pricing unbelievable in this day and age.They are efficient and have always helped solve whatever issue I'm having (not always the friendliest, but I guess that's part of the efficiency really).I have run as many as three websites through them with almost no problem at all. I could find cheaper service but have no interest in changing because of the fine service they deliver."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Henryk Dabrowski,"Monday, January 19, 2015","The server is very stable. I have never experienced downtime with Gigapros. The support is extremely helpful! Since day one when I try to move my magento website from my previous host to this new VPS host, they helped me completely move the website and set it up and running without any additional charges.For any questions, even the low priorities, they reply to me really fast and very helpful. They even help me solve my website's problems which is far beyond my expectation."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Oussama Scheers,"Friday, January 16, 2015","I can express the point that it was hard for me to choose the right web host between tons of options available in the net. After reading good reviews about gigapros.com service, I also decided to give them a try and host several of my web sites. I've used Gigapros for a while now. I've never had any issues and love the ability to up all the server stats on the fly during our busy seasons.Their uptime and service have both been spectacular. Their features look unique: - you get 100% guaranteed server resource allocation at all times.  - their support options: Live Chat, Phone Calls, Forums, Knowledge Base & E-mails. - they use high-end premium quality servers (99.9% uptime guaranteed).For me, the extra bit of cash is well paid in the astounding support. I would highly recommend this decent web host for you, guys. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,E.Barros Santos,"Thursday, January 15, 2015","Reliable, cost-effective, virtually trouble-free operation. When problems occur, they provide great technical support - quick replies to my questions, fast turn-around on technical problems, problems get fixed right the first time. My site is always up and has a incredible ammount of bandwidth. You can not go wrong with Gigapros.comThe support is practically on MSN/AIM/ICQ every time I have needed something. The pricing is affordable, even to a student like me!If I went to any other host I should've paid 2 times more than I do currently.So I'd say, use Gigapros for all your hosting!"

Could not have asked for a better hosting company in my opinion! Will be with Gigapros for a long time. Excellent value hosting packages and a service that I cannot fault, plus a sense of humour. Tickets are usually answered with 10 minutes of submission and their support staff is extremely obliging.Excellent value for money."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Reima Myllyniemi,"Tuesday, January 13, 2015","Finding the new hosting provider was more difficult then getting a new customer. One of my customer introduced me to Gigapros, he was already using this web provider to host few of his websites. As the reviewers have already mentioned Gigapros has been a great host from what I had before. Support is top notch! I can even text a support and get answers pretty quickly. They are honest about any issues arising and explain why issues happen.They are available 24/7 on live chat, email and phone.They are really the most friendly host company I have ever worked with.Solid hosting services so far, keep it up!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Daniela Schulz,"Monday, January 12, 2015","Gigapros claims to be a top notch drupal host - i can say that it's true. Their features impressed me a lot when I started hosting one of my web sites. I have been with them for more than three months and have had very few problems, and the problems I have had have been put right really fast, sometimes in less than 5 minutes.The tutorials are helpful. It's a great service.It's a good sense to be supported and discuss with someone else far away on the other side of the internet.I'll transfer some of my other web sites as well to this decent web host."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Carola Sulander,"Thursday, January 8, 2015","I have been with Giga Pros for a long time. While they don't have much variety in their packages (they only have two...they had just the one when I first signed up so they are improving), what they do offer is outstanding. Their tech support is extremely fast. I have gotten responses to my e-mails not even 5 minutes later. They have a lot of features available starting at their hosting packages - $10/month - their features are hard to beat. Their customer service makes it a no-brainer.I've been very happy with their service and recommend them to anyone."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Corrine Lowe,"Monday, December 15, 2014","The services offered by Gigapros.com are far superior to my previous hosting service, which I had for more than 4 months. Contact with sales, technical support, and billing has been prompt and pleasant. However, I don't feel that the help goes beyond scripted responses and links to knowledge base articles, and perhaps no further help is needed. Everything truly is at one's fingertips. The prices have gone up for the cloud hosting accounts, but I think there is a point where you have to accept that to a large extent, you get what you pay for. It is still very reasonable in my opinion, the stability is excellent, and the support is priceless. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Van Langen,"Thursday, December 11, 2014","I am a developer that does web sites for clients. I have had my own account with Gigapros for about 5 months, no problems.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Giovanna Cunha,"Wednesday, November 26, 2014","There is no doubt that Gigapros is the way to go, I have had hosting with them for over 8 months now and my site has only been down one time. Support is readily available and always leads to a correct answer. This web host is the best in the biz.For a shared hosting account, they have great features and service. The technical support is limited to extremely basic and simplistic questions. If you need to ask any questions out of ordinary you're on your own. They have great prices and understand the importance of reliable web hosting. I recommend Gigapros, inc to everyone in need of a website."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Nicephorus Pokrovsky,"Friday, November 21, 2014","Gigapros.com are simply the best at what they do. No doubt. The downtime is absolutely microscopic when there is a problem.For all that you get with their hosting, the price you pay is well worth it. For shared hosting, the support alone is worth what you would pay. With everything else you receive, Gigapros is beyond worth buying.Control panels are amazing, the system is very solid altogether. Knowledge Base - you've gotta use it to understand. 90% of my questions answered in a simple, accessible google like environment. It's beautiful."

This allows me to host multiple sites under the same account, where each site is treated with full independence. Essentially, multisite allows me to organise my project the way I want.Best hosting company out there plain and simple."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Gualterio,"Tuesday, November 11, 2014","Well, I recommend Gigapros VPS hosting to any entity who needs to get a Web site up and running. Youll get all the help you need from the very beginning of your relationship with these people, and at a remarkably competitive price. heir support is very responsive and willing to work through with you any problems related to your hosting. As with most providers, though, add-ons or more advanced features will cost you. Very kind, easy to work with, and exceptional service and value.Great satisfaction and reliability. Highly recommended."

I haven't had many reseller accounts but I just can't see how any hosting company can be any better. I get responses and solutions quicker than I expect. Their servers are really fast. They never seem bothered that I'm asking questions and their price? Honestly. If you're a reseller, would you rather pay less for less service? As it is, they're price is one of the lowest. When you consider the level of service you get, then the price is a bargain.When you need a hosting company to be more then just hard drive space I recommend Gigapros."

The good thing about gigapros is that it allows me to personalize or in other words edit my php.ini file which i consider an important element which we usually find in dedicated servers. It has a good amount of storage that lets me host quite large files and also has good download speeds as know from my visitors who download the hosted files on server.Huge repository of answered FAQ, and they respond very fast to any questions I have."

I highly recommend Gigapros services.
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Joelle Los,"Tuesday, August 19, 2014","So I decided to start a hobby that I had thinking about for a while and write a website to sell books.I did a couple of days' of research before choosing a hosting company, and decided that despite the fact that they're fairly new to the scene, I would try gigapros.com because I had heard some good things.They even post their server statistics - not the flashiest web intro., but to somebody who KNOWS the web, this is incredible openness about their services.Their staff are personable, patient, and very attentive. They solved a problem promptly and with ease, and were informative along the way. They'll help you get started and make sure your website is up, running, and cranking away."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ivano Trentini,"Monday, August 18, 2014","After frustrating and unreliability experiences with other hosting services (including very large, well known hosts), I started a search a few years ago for a hosting provider that people were actually happy with. That's how I found Gigapros. The volume of comments from happy customers led me to call Gigapros.I have referred 3 friends to the service so far and all say activation has been approximately between 30 - 90 minutes. Regardless of the time I open a ticket, someone responds so it seems they have somebody watching out for orders 24/7.Recommended!"

I also really loved Gigapros support team. keep the good work.With Gigapros I always get a quick response! I've never had to wait to speak to someone, or to have them return an email.They never hesitated to help and always make things right. Their professionalism is evident from the very first time you contact you have with them.They did the backups and transfers until the old host finally made a good copy that was usable. They spent about a week just to get my sites all moved and running correct.I like my new web host and highly recommend it to other webmasters and webdesigners. "

Support phone answers withing a reasonable amount of time.Great customer service so far. They called me immediately to verify my order, and when I had some 'basic' unresolved problems, they investigated and got back to me in a few days. Up-time on the hosting has been flawless, as far as I know. The only downside is that access to cpanel and POP has sometimes been unreliable. Overall, I'd recommend them still."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Dorothee Champagne,"Friday, August 8, 2014","I started with Gigapros small package. The service was great. My rep then upgraded me for free and assisted me with moving from VPS to my own server. I have grown from 1 website to 30 and still have clients on the way.

With numerous websites hosted, I have had no down time to speak of and if I have any questions or need extra support they are always super quick to respond. Highly recommend. "

This is to be expected with the kind of growth they've experienced, however.The price is attractive. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Emanuele Cremonesi,"Wednesday, August 6, 2014","My experiences with Gigapros have been 100 percent positive.

Instant support, and if you can't get through to you by chat, I have never waited more than 10 hours to receive a reply by email! They don't lie about their uptime.

They helped transfer my account and provided reassurances of better service.I'm paying half of what I was paying at my other host! It places high value on customer support and it shows.

I am extremely happy with their services and doubt I will go anywhere else for my hosting needs. For all that you get with their hosting, the price you pay is well worth it.

I must admit, the guys over at Gigapros seemed to do everything in their power that they could to get the situation resolved. They are always willing to take that extra step.

The billing process is a little convoluted, but not a big deal - just pay attention to what they are asking you to do. The live help webchat was a godsend and the site itself has been very cheap and easy to use. Lots of features, and I can afford to pay a year at a go.I like my web host."

They even have a little box that lets you select how experienced a user you are so that they may tailor the response to your needs!Features are reasonably good, but the panel can be a pain sometimes. They use a custom Control Panel, but it is fairly well feature packed, and easy to use. It just takes getting used to.I've found their service quite prompt, knowledgeable and courteous."

Would recommend these guys to anyone.It's easy to set up, paypal payments - mean that from Asia my payments are easily done.With other hosts you end up on hold forever or talking to someone who reads a script off of a screen and tells you to re-start your computer. The guys with Gigapros are no nonsense and respond promptly both with follow-up emails and to any additional questions I'll throw at them. They've sent me error logs, done lots of digging and helped out with all kinds of problems I've had with wordpress installs and other issues. Tickets are usually answered with 10 minutes of submission and their support staff is extremely obliging.Overall excellent value. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Brian M. Fairweather,"Tuesday, April 22, 2014","I recommend Gigapros hosting to any entity who needs to get a web site up and running.

They repond quickly, know how to fix problems, spend an appropriate amount of time investigating and responding to issues.Their uptime is very good. They have adjusted their pricing plans over time to keep them competitive and currently are extremely competitive in their pricing.The only thing I could ask for is some additional customization of features at the same price points.Go and compare yourself, with the support and uptime, you really can't go wrong with them."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Daniele Schiavone,"Thursday, April 17, 2014","I'll give Gigapros props, nobody will ever beat them price wise for what they offer. I call for support frequently and never wait for more than 2 minutes until i talk with someone. I have 100% uptime so far and couldn't be happier.Simply, I just like where they stand - trying out new things, and trying to be on top of it always.As long as they stick to their guns on not overselling their servers, I don't think I'll ever be looking for a new web host."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Doreen Bieber,"Wednesday, April 16, 2014","I decided to share my experience dealing with Gigapros web host. It happened so that one of my friends recommended me to try them, so I ordered their basic shared hosting plans for $2.99/mo - resources and features fit my needs. I paid via paypal, their support helped me with setup and offered me free website builder with a list of unique templates to choose from - this is a great plus for them. Well, as for their network and server uptime - superb, my site is up and I am glad. Besides, I would like to say that my pages load very fast. I like Gigapros, it is really good web host."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Mulham Musa Aswad,"Friday, April 11, 2014","I am so thankful Gigapros looked things over objectively and balked at shutting me down. I'm still trying to crawl out from under this debt which has been almost halved over the years but their support has been superb and gone the extra mile when I needed it. I'd rather wait longer for the correct answer than be given several wrong answers very quickly, which ends up wasting more time, which greatly muddles my learning process. Their responses to Pre-sales questions before I joined and their support afterwards has been more efficient than I ever expected.The features are top notch and have been unmatched by almost all the hosts I have ever seen.I like Gigapros web host. Recommended!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Kaarina Harkimo,"Thursday, April 10, 2014","I've been moving from host to host trying different ones out, and so far Gigapros is the most promising one.

I would recommend them to anyone who needs hosting at a great price, with all add-ons included in that price."

I decided to share my experience dealing with them. When I contacted them, they explained me everything in details and offered me a helping hand to setup my web site. What I want to add is that their control panel has a myriad of things you can add to your web site - great deal. I tell them with confidence that they'll be just as satisfied as I am. Gigapros does everything it promises and more, and that's a rarity these days. In my opinion they're the best kept secret for quality, reliable hosting."

First class service and support. Have been a customer for the last 8 months and have never had a issue with performance. They have upgraded Apache helped increase performance all without passing on any cost. If you want that personalized service then this is the place."

It is a great hosting site for the basics for development - cpanel, PHP/MySQL, and plenty of space for cheap. The service, both as a web host and in dealing with customers, has been most satisfactory. Up-time has always been in the high 90s. Their control panels are easy to use and intuitive, as is their account and billing interface. They could double their price and I would stay with them. They are that good and you won't be disappointed. I don't think I will ever leave. "

Gigapros is a good web host. Site took a couple of days to get working, but the people were lovely. The live help webchat was a godsend and the site itself has been very cheap and easy to use. Lots of features, and I can afford to pay a year at a go. The pricing plan is good, and the control panel is nice as well. They even have nice scripting extras and spamassassin. Domain registration is a few dollars too high, but that's my only complaint. Thanks Gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Kimberly Matthews,"Wednesday, April 2, 2014","Gigapros is relaible. I went on the recommendation of a friend and now dedicated server with them and thanks to their pricing and support. Their server setup is also epic, their custom servers can take up to 7 days, which is short for a technical department that makes dozens of them a day. Their network is brilliant, I've not noticed any downtime or connection problems, when pinging the server it's less than 50MS, which Is brilliant due to my poor home internet connection. My server hardware has so far been functioning very well.I'd recommend Gigapros to anyone looking for a budget dedicated server located in USA."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Kevin Fisher,"Tuesday, April 1, 2014","Gigapros has a fantastic swift support and with an amazing high quality. Customer care and professionalism: Absolutely brilliant. I've never seen something so good, so professional. It is especially nice that they do not snub us because we are so slow. They are so polite and helpful. I've moved over a website from another server to Gigapros because of the superior service and features at a very good price. If you are with doubts don't even risk your name (in front of your clients eyes) with any other hosting services other than Gigapros. It is real good web host."

Took only 12 hours to get the new server built, took 4 days to migrate to the new server (my site was only down for 90 mins at the end). Never really had any problems with the server, I run a managed dedicated server with them and speeds have been great. Never had any down times yet.

Their pricing is also extremely fair, especially when considering their reliability, service and support. Not only is their hardware awesome, they respond like instantly to questions and support issues. Try getting a response from the big hosting companies...

Gigapros is reliable option to deal with.The whole concept of a company is making money, but their hosting seems to think otherwise. Customers comes first and money comes later. Their knowledge base has enough information for someone like myself to get to grips with things, while their customer service is so good at times I almost feel spoilt, having always been fast in response and informative with problems being resolved in a short time. Don't be fooled by the super cheap traps out there. Gigapros can be trusted."

This time, they were able to go beyond what I reported to him, and fix issues I didn't even know about before he mentioned them to me. They even went as far as to rebuild the modules needed for my script to be 100% positive the issue wasn't server-side only. In the end, we learned that many of the issues were related to permissions.

Always willing to assist me over and over again with even the smallest request. Their control panels are easy to use and intuitive, as is their account and billing interface. Everything is great and I could not be happier with my hosting selection. Service is stellar, pricing is reasonable, flexibility is unbelievable."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Randy S. ,"Friday, January 17, 2014","I can't believe it, I finally found a GREAT host! It is called Gigapros! Their support is TOP, their support guy added me on Skype so he could help me better and answer my questions. Their server setup is ok, their custom servers can take up to 7 days, which is short for a technical department that makes dozens of them a day. If you are in need of a reliable host in particular, Gigapros is the place to get one. The value for the money can't be beat."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Hella Tretyakova,"Thursday, January 16, 2014","I've been with Gigapros for more than 7 months on a shared hosting plan. The whole concept of a company is making money, but Gigapros hosting seems to think otherwise. Customers comes first and money comes later. What I like about them are: - great uptime (99.9% as promised), - 24/7 Helpful Customer Support, - Free Tools for running any kind of web sites, - Fast Speed connection.I would recommend Gigapros hosting to anyone who is serious about his/her online business!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Sophe Chapa Guajardo,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","No doubt, Gigapros is extremely reliable and the sites go up fast and stay up. The email customer support is fantastic even when the problems are self-created. I've tried other services that looked cheaper on the outside but have always come back to these guys. If you log on to their site you get an ad page before you get to the page you want but there is always a continue button and I can live with it for the value. Very reliable."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Lilian Nawar,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","Let me say that I decided to leave gigapros.com after less than one week. Here is my experience with gigapros.com very briefly. 1. They promised to migrate my sites, I sent them my login information. After 4 days, I contacted them and they told me that everything is ready and after changing the DNS, we discover that they have not migrated the sites. An old back- up that I had was used to upload the files to my account. 2. There was a cashing plugin that caused one of the sites not to work and I was given URLs of websites that I can hire to fix the problem, when I looked at it, I realized that all I have to do was delete the plugin through file manager. This was the second red flag that made me feel uncomfortable about them. It was very obvious they are not going to give you support but to make money out of you. 3. Two days later my sites were suspended because my inodes were sometimes going over 100,000. Though there were no terms to limit the inodes and when I asked them they said that every company has its own rules, and though the limit on my account is 250,000 according to their rules that they do not reveal before signing-up. 4. It was clear that these people are trouble makers and so I hired someone to migrate the sites. My backup was deleted and then they changed the server configuration so that I was not able to login to my cpanel and sites were given 403 forbidden when I try to login and if someone tries to navigate the site, they would get 404 error. That night I threatened them that I would report them to authority on the basis of damaging my business. 5. Eventually, I was able to login to cpanel but not the admin panels of the sites. They kept arguing that I should be able to login, when I checked the error logs of all the sites, it was clear that the server modules were changed causing the problems that I had experienced. The error logs shows the same error taking place at all the sites at almost the same time. The sites were down for almost 4 days after which I was able to transfer them. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Anthony Duffy,"Tuesday, January 14, 2014","I don't have much experience with other web hosting services, so it's hard to compare, but so far I've been impressed that my support tickets get answered quickly by Gigapros people who seem to be technically savvy. My website response times have never been faster and support level is above and beyond. If you are thinking about switching, this is the company to go with. Good range of price plans and options for the novice to the expert. Gigapros has provided excellent and very prompt service and troubleshooting transferring our blog to their hosting."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Alex Mcsterling,"Monday, January 13, 2014","I've had nothing but success when working with Gigapros team of experts. The set-up was fast - I was transferring my test sites within minutes of receiving their (five) instant welcome emails. They did the backups and transfers until the old host finally made a good copy that was usable. Their professionalism is evident from the very first time you contact you have with them. Value for what I'm receiving is excellent. Speed connectivity is pretty fast, uptime is great and features are unqiue. They also offer very useful free tools. It is an extremely proficient host and usually manages to answer support tickets in 10 minutes or less."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Bogdan Smerko,"Friday, January 10, 2014","So far, I am extremely impressed with these guys. I've been an Gigapros customer for over 8 months now, there attention to detail, great customer service and excellent pricing make them the only choice for my web hosting needs, I would recommend them to anyone. The availability of both live online support and phone support is fine. Recently-ish they have made it possible for only business plans to have parked domains, which means a pricey upgrade if you want to host two of your small personal sites with the same account. Very kind, easy to work with, and exceptional service and value. The perfect host!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Pavel Chytil,"Thursday, January 9, 2014","Like most I did the research and spent hours looking at reviews for the various hosts. Having read good reviews about GigaPros services, I decided to give them a try. I contacted them directly, told my requirements and their team offered me a good fit for my needs. It took about a half hour to an hour for my VPS to be configured and ready. The server that I was placed on was faster in just about every way than the servers I had been on in the past and I have not experienced any downtime that I was not notified about beforehand. Given their recent upgrades and expanded offerings I see no reason I would ever go anywhere else! "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Robert Toskalos,"Wednesday, January 8, 2014","Love these guys. I've been with Gigapros for more than 8 months and have loved their hosting and service. They are great - I had some initial troubles setting up/transferring from my old host but customer support was very helpful. They have a live chat feature that's very useful for real time problem solving. The only thing I would change is to make the interface more user friendly when editing my Web sites. And for what you get, the prices are fantastic. Lots of features!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Elsa Karttiala,"Monday, January 6, 2014","I'd like to say that Gigapros are the most professional and engaging technical professionals I've dealt with in the past 10 years. I had a couple of questions during the initial setup, I received very quick and informative responses from the staff at Gigapros. I am very happy with the performance of my sites there. Leaving that apart, things have been great so far - it was easy to setup the site, transfer the files/sql data and so I'm giving it a 5 throughout."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,David Price,"Friday, January 3, 2014","Well, Gigapros have been an amazing host. Support is quick and extremely helpful. All of my issues and questions were answered within a few minutes at most, and the issues themselves were quickly resolved as well. Its server is also more stable and reliable than the host I had. Top notch support, affordable pricing, and I haven't seen a bit of downtime. They're cheap, bandwidth is plenty and domains unlimited but you get what you pay for! Gigapros is an extremely proficient company and usually manages to answer support tickets in 10 minutes or less."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Sarah Kharitonova,"Monday, December 30, 2013","It happened so that I signed up for Gigapros in May 2013 and it's been an excellent experience. I enjoy the up close and personal approach of the administrators and the support is always fast and accurate. My uptime has been fabulous and I love how much space I have for a relatively low price.They deliver a genuine focus on problem-solving. I've tested 100 connections at once with the wordpress website. They paused in 2 minutes, and then they operated normally as if nothing had happened. Performance is great, up-time too, and the service is phenomenal!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Robert Fiala,"Monday, December 30, 2013","I like Gigapros hosting. It is one of the most professional and engaging technical professionals I've dealt with in the past 10 years. I had a couple of questions during the initial setup, I received very quick and informative responses from the staff. The billing process is a little convoluted, but not a big deal - just pay attention to what they are asking you to do. And for what you get, the prices are fantastic. Lots of companies charge a lot more for a lot less. Don't look any further just go for Gigapros and you'll be happy."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ayoub Jas,"Saturday, December 28, 2013","I looked online for reviews of Gigapros and found only positive reviews which I thought was fishy since it was too good to be true.According to the support, they are very prompt and giving 100% perfect answers to the customer. If there are any other problem, they will connect to the client machine through logmein account and they will fix it. Their control panels are easy to use and intuitive, as is their account and billing interface. Very kind, easy to work with, and exceptional service and value. The perfect host!"

The availability of both live online support and phone support is fine. They are the most professional and engaging technical professionals I've dealt with in the past 10 years. They go above and beyond the call of duty, something that is rare in today's business climate. As far as the up-time. It is very good. I have monitoring software for keeping up-time statistics and so far the up-time is unparralled. Overall, I absolutely thrilled to be hosting with them! Why choose a different host? All you need is Gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Cammile Courtois,"Tuesday, December 24, 2013","Gigapros is a very good hosting company so far. They have excellent support, and prices are good. There is always a very intelligent person on the other end of live chat who takes care of your needs immediately. Sites are always up and run as fast. Easy to set up, paypal payments means that from the US my payments are easily done, and any isues we've come up with have been solved through the online support chat by people who are always helpful and polite. Well done guys. Other hosting companies could learn a bit from you guys on pricing, technology and excellent customer service."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Alexander N. Olsen,"Tuesday, December 24, 2013","I'm pleased to say that Gigapros.com have delivered exactly on their 99.9% uptime promise. So far, everything has been absolutely amazing. Their VPS systems are fully managed and the help they provide is impeccable. Very happy so far and my sites are loading much quicker and I am now in control of my server, no limitations and fully managed so if there is anything I would like to experiment with I know I have the help at hand, no more signing up to forums to get a bunch of nonsensical answers or scouring the internet, a simple email away and they will provide all the details I need. Thanks Gigapros for providing me with professional services!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Jan Kopecky,"Friday, December 20, 2013","I went through five different hosts before finding Gigapros. For me Gigapros have extremely fast network. The features are top notch and have been unmatched by almost all the hosts I have ever seen. This web host, besides a robust infrastructure, has an exceptional support. They've handled every ticket quickly, and with the responses you'd want from the very start. The prices are higher but they do not oversell and you get what you pay for. Everything is simply amazing and has remained consistently so."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Elijah Trollope,"Thursday, December 19, 2013","I can honestly say that Gigapros has lived up to what is advertised. First off, no hosting company can give you a 100% uptime. I have been with gigapros for over 7 months now.Their support team have replied to approx 48 emails within the first 4 weeks and each and everyone of my responses have been timely and fulfilled.I dont really enjoy learning about web servers and stuff, however, I have enjoyed getting everything setup, you just need to have a level of patience and explain everything in detail and everything will happen.Very Mac friendly interface. If you value excellent service, advice and professional support don't look any further. Gigapros is great! "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Stanislao Marcelo,"Wednesday, December 18, 2013","They have great customer support. I love the prices. The server was down for about 15 minutes one month. That's pretty good up time! Gigapros is reliable and professional web host. Now, I do want to say that Gigapros has been responsive in their dealings, which cannot be said about many other companies. Overall, this appears to be a decent company that is really trying to make a good name for itself in the web hosting business. I am very happy with the performance of my sites there. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Nickolas Jersington,"Tuesday, December 17, 2013","Gigapros team is always helpful with questions for beginners. Reliable and affordable prices. They were extremely patient as I cluelessly asked for various ports to be opened to allow extra functionality on one of my sites. Uptime is (nearly) 100%. You know, I've encountered a few small hick-ups in the last 9 months but in fact I haven't encountered any problems during the last 5 months. Youll get all the help you need from the very beginning of your relationship with these people, and at a remarkably competitive price."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Jake Woods,"Monday, December 16, 2013","They are feature rich and answer trouble tickets usually within 30 minutes to an hour. You can rely on Gigapros, your sites will be in good hands. Their SSH access is a very nice added bonus and allows you to use your hosting as a place to run perl and ruby scripts. Their support team is very good. My uptime has been fabulous and I love how much space I have for a relatively low price. They have easy to use admin section and one click installs. Nothing to worry about, they are professional."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Sante Palerma,"Friday, December 13, 2013","After being disappointed time after time by hosting companies, I finally found Gigapros! Been with them for 9 months for various ventures and all have been great. Support is excellent, servers are fast, and their pricing is very affordable. Sure, there are some a bit cheaper providers around, but this one is fully managed, not to mention the hardware quality and godlike uptime. I am extremely happy with their services and doubt I will go anywhere else for my hosting needs."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,J. Beesley,"Thursday, December 12, 2013","Speed of this VPS is remarkable, especially when considering the base price - which is about as low as a VPS gets. Gigapros is really good host I must say. I've had support tickets answered promptly at all hours of the night. I actually enjoy getting their newsletter every month - they're hilarious, in a moderately-amusing way. As long as they stick to their guns on not overselling their servers, I don't think I'll ever be looking for a new web host. I definitely would recommend them to any friends of mine."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Aletta Duister,"Wednesday, December 11, 2013","I'd like to say that Gigapros is what all companies should strive for when it comes to customer service and support. I know my limits and don't have to worry about violating any unwritten terms of service. Especially since Gigapros provides a massive amount of bandwidth in their most basic shared hosting package. Uptime has been rock solid! Web page loads fast and my visitors do not complain. They provide great scripting tools such as PHP 4 and 5, Ruby on Rails, Python, CGI, etc. Overall, a good host, and enjoyable to use."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ausilia Capon,"Tuesday, December 10, 2013","Gigapros is inexpensive, and they have a nice control panel. After figuring out how to set up my main account, I had my existing site converted over in a matter of minutes. Support replied to my ticket and had resolved the issue in minutes of submission. I had to create a subsequent ticket for an outgoing issue, which ended up being a port that needed enabled on my firewall. That issue took a little longer to find and resolve, but the Gigapros support team was knowledgeable, extremely quick to respond and solve the trouble. If you are in need of a VPS in particular, this is the place to get one. The value for the money can't be beat."

Sign up was easy, support is great, speed is fantastic. Their tech people helped me with everything I needed. Their cPanel makes it very easy to navigate everything for someone who doesn't know too much about the intricate workings of webhosts and servers. They also offer great tools, easy to use with intuitive video training available. Price seems very competitive (another reason I went with this provider). So if you want an inexpensive and very functional site, Gigapros is the way to go. "

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Nick McSparling,"Wednesday, December 4, 2013","Never really had any problems with the server, we run a managed dedicated server with Gigapros and speeds have been great.

Best host I've ever been with."

And the c-panel makes it very easy to navigate everything for someone who doesn't know too much about the intricate workings of webhosts and servers.

If your site experiences more traffic than the server can handle, it goes down. The same is true if any of the other sites hosted on your server are overloaded. I have used some web hosting service, this happened always. I decided to give gigapros.com a try and they impressed me a lot. They've hosted my WordPress blog for my business for 10 months now and the responsiveness through their customer-service is reason enough to stay with them.

I get an excellent package, the ability to host unlimited domains & subdomains. Even things like cron jobs, subversion servers, etc. I've found their service quite prompt, knowledgeable and courteous."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Myhailo Prohorenko,"Wednesday, October 30, 2013","I have had an account with Gigapros.com for almost 1 year and have been extremely pleased with the service and support. Given their recent upgrades and expanded offerings I see no reason I would ever go anywhere else given that they now have an upgrade path for those that outgrow a VPS and need a dedicated server. I've had very little down-time, if any at all. I won't say there was none, but to be honest with you, I actually can't remember any at all. Support gets back to you always within an hour and reliability has been great."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Denis Rodman,"Tuesday, October 29, 2013","I got my Gigapros shared hosting account for 50 bucks for a whole year. That was amazing. Unlimited everything, free domain, and all of that. I moved my entire site myself, including databases, so I can say only positive things on their site transferring service.

All of my issues and questions were answered within a few minutes at most, and the issues themselves were quickly resolved as well.I can say that my site and email access have certainly seen improvement in speed and short-term reliability since the move. The set-up was fast - I was transferring my test sites within minutes of receiving their (five) instant welcome emails. The outages have never lasted too long either. Finally, they have a great newsletter and make you feel at home."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,James Savage,"Wednesday, October 16, 2013","I can not express how happy I am with Gigapros services.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Zane Sparling,"Monday, October 14, 2013",Where these guys really excel is in customer service. With other hosts you end up on hold forever or talking to someone who reads a script off of a screen and tells you to re-start your computer. The guys at Gigapros are no nonsense and respond promptly both with follow-up emails and to any additional questions I'll throw at them. Easy to use interface. The pricing is very reasonable. Site is extremely fast to load and has had almost perfect uptime.

There have been some issues with server slowdowns however they where promptly resolved by gigapros hence the perfect score."

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Leuco Montero Viera,"Tuesday, October 8, 2013","Gigapros has a great support team, I have send them 2 support questions and I receive the answer to my questions within a few hours. The response times are lightning fast (the longest I have had to wait for a response to a ticked question was just over 1 hour - which is more than acceptable, seeing as other bigger companies can take 7-14 days to reply). One thing that attracts me is also their pricing. Their tools are great. I am so glad I found this company and will be recommending them to all my friends and clients."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ricardo Adreano,"Monday, October 7, 2013","Just had a problem with the my site. I was fixing some code in a PHP file. Well seems like I did something to set my site offline.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Jonas Wolf,"Wednesday, October 2, 2013","This is really the PERFECT HOSTING COMPANY. Transferred all my sites to Gigapros and no regrets! Uptime: perfect, Service: perfect. My page was attacked by script kiddies on several occasions and their support responded quickly and effectively, helping to harden my site against further attacks. The thing that I have been most impressed with during my time with Gigapros is their Customer support. Their friendly and timely manner aside, this is even more impressive when I have built and administer this site from Norway.We'll be with Gigapros for a long time to come I think. And would recommend anyone to give them a try."

As to my experience with Gigapros hosting for last 6 months - I would say you can rely on it. The connection/download page speed is very good.  After figuring out how to set up my main account, I had my existing site converted over in a matter of minutes. The first thing I did was install a Shoutcast server and then started in on some PHP testing. It was during my testing that I needed some support from KnownHost to check a few settings. Support replied to my ticket and had resolved the issue in minutes of submission. I had to create a subsequent ticket for an outgoing issue, which ended up being a port that needed enabled on my firewall. That issue took a little longer to find and resolve, but the KnownHost support team was knowledgeable, extremely quick to respond and solved all the troubles. My business has grown as a direct result of the service and support they offer."

They gave me two public IP addresses! I had to pay my previous provider extra to get just one. I installed Lighty and with a little work, was able to host both Drupal and MediaWiki sites. If you are not 100% happy with the place you are now at, then can highly recommend Gigapros to you."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Tin Marjanovic,"Tuesday, August 6, 2013","Well, gigapros.com is pretty reliable from what I've seen.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,David Liston,"Friday, August 2, 2013","You can trust Gigapros web host. They've hosted my WordPress blog for my business for about a year now and the responsiveness through their customer-service is reason enough to stay with them. I've only written in to the support staff to talk about upgrading my package, as my site has expanded greatly on their servers. They've handled every ticket quickly, and with the responses you'd want from the very start. Their account system is great, switch between plans easily and manage multiple plans with 1 set of login info. They mean business and they provide excellent service. "

Cheap reliable and effective hosting provider."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Michela Moretti,"Wednesday, July 24, 2013","I switched to Gigapros after several days of research. I was with another host, but this web host topped all the features and had rave reviews by everyone. The dedicated servers are sold with set specs as I found they had better processors in them and I had an extra 2 GBs of RAM! More performance for my sites so I didn't complain! The support guys at are simply excellent, you can see the difference in service and it matter a lot to me. Their focus is clearly geared towards medium- to large-sized business."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Maria Horvat,"Friday, July 19, 2013","GigaPros support impressed me immensely. When I talked to one of their support guys, I had no feeling from him of wanting to fix my problem as quickly as he could so he could move on the next customer; instead, he made sure he completely understood the issue I was having and did everything he could to fix it, which he did. He also explained what the issue was in a way I could understand. I have never talked to more helpful toll-free support. I'm staying, because they are good."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Giovanni Pugliesi,"Tuesday, July 16, 2013","So far so good. Server performance is excellent and I am glad to have found Gigapros.com. At first, it took me a while to get up and running because I had no clue how to use the vps. Once I got a hang of it, the system is very easy to use and their control panel makes it easy to manage your server. I can access my vps from any computer and it has never failed on me. I was pleasantly surprised by the backup tools you provide which I did not expect at all. I recommend Gigapros with all my heart."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ryan Mattew,"Monday, July 15, 2013","No one in this hosting space comes near Gigapros.com they own this sphere.

They rock, I love them and been with them for a year."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Manuel Panicucci,"Monday, July 15, 2013","I hosted my site at Gigapros.com for over year. The company is open for anyone who is curious about their services. All you have to do is ask; either on their forum, or privately via email. What truly surprises is how honest their answers are. I probably don't know as much as I should about the ins and outs of having a large website, but with Gigapros by my side, I never worry about that anymore! Truly special. The move to Gigapros was a win-win for me. Better service and better value."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Epicuro Calderon,"Thursday, July 11, 2013","I had a fully manged server with Gigapros.com for about a year. There have been a few glitches, but service is remarkably fast even at 5 in the morning and things were fixed quickly. It has one killer feature for me: multisite.

I love that they have live chat available 24/7 and go above and beyond for their customers. They have gone above and beyond to assist me with my sites, whenever needed. Amazingly, I never had to wait longer than 20 minutes for a response. You might pay a couple of bucks less, but it's just not worth it if it takes hour after hour and even days to respond. As far as the up-time. It is very good. I have monitoring software for keeping up-time statistics and so far the up-time is unparralled. I'm very happy with them so far."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Belisarda Lavallee,"Wednesday, June 26, 2013","I am really happy to have found this great hosting service. After you sign up with Gigapros, they contact you during the first week just to know if you are happy and have no technie troubles.

I've checked many webhosts and it was very hard to make a final choice because the hosting market is so competitive. Decided to give Gigapros.com web host a try. These guys seem to really know what they're doing. I contacted them via Live Chat, told my requirements and their experts found a good solution for me.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Mark Shulz,"Wednesday, September 5, 2012","Excellent web host, uptime is perfect (more than 99% so far), and they know their stuff. I have upgraded to a dedicated server, and I am continuing to expand my client base. Once again, only very minor issues have arisen since the switch to the dedicated server, but I am happy to say that I have had an overall 9/10 experience with Gigapros. Tech support has been pretty good as most of my tickets have been responded to within the hour. Highly recommend Gigapros hosting!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Suresh Badi,"Tuesday, September 4, 2012","They're honest, fast and thorough. I have never waited more than an hour for a reply, even when submitting support tickets at 3 or 4 in the morning on a weekend. They've provided more than what I need. Gigapros uptime is great and pages are loaded fast. They could double their price and I would stay with them. They are that good and you won't be disappointed. I don't think I will ever leave. You won't either."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Viker Turrit,"Thursday, August 30, 2012","Well, my uptime and support have been excellent - they actually answer their emails, and within a few minutes! They even re-installed my content management system for me after they found out the problem I had stemmed from me installing the wrong version. They have a lot of features useful for running any web site. Can't quibble about the price either. I can't imagine being happier with a hosting service."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Vasiliy Alexeyev,"Wednesday, August 29, 2012","Gigapros is the best one. We have seen the addition of more and more servers to keep up with demand. They are always responsive, cost-effective, and we virtually never suffer any down time. I have good things only to say about them the staff members there are all extremely helpful and have always gone out of their way to assist me when I have needed it. The claim of 99.99% uptime holds true. You will not be disappointed."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Luiferr,"Wednesday, August 22, 2012",I have seen many web hosts which are excellent at the beginning (once you signed up with them) and then become very bad in terms of service and  support. This is NOT about Gigapros! They provided me with good service in October when I started and they still provide good service for me now! So a really good service always a good service! 
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Paul Kuster,"Tuesday, August 21, 2012",I have web sites hosted with Gigapros and with other companies as well.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Oliver Salamanka,"Friday, August 17, 2012","About a year ago I started migrating my clients' sites to Gigapros and the process has been easy, with no glitches.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Moris LeFleur,"Thursday, August 9, 2012","Well, gigapros is always running hosting specials ranging from bottom of the barrel to comparable prices for both individuals and businesses. Technical support is unsurpassed, and they even give you a call/e-mail you when the server is down, or a certain service is affected. Given their recent upgrades and expanded offerings I see no reason I would ever go anywhere else given that they now have an upgrade path for those that outgrow a VPS and need a dedicated server. I am satisfied!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Micheal Owens,"Tuesday, August 7, 2012",Pricing is unbelievable. I needed a site to post recorded lectures for fellow classmates and my own podcast. Gigapros have a plethora of software to choose from and free assistance in developing a webpage. I haven't had single problem yet. They were quick to answer my technical questions. Very happy using their service.
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Sandro Nesta,"Thursday, August 2, 2012","I have never had problems with gigapros at all, I can honestly say that. In fact only today I spoke to an online helper and they helped me solve a email problem within 15minutes. I've finally found a good home with gigapros. I especially love their support. They're easy to talk to, friendly and they seem to really care about their clients. I would recommend them to anyone. I build websites for people and often use gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Kom Litern,"Monday, July 30, 2012",I was looking for the highest-rated company with the largest number of positive reviews. My first pick was gigapros.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Danilo Turk,"Friday, July 13, 2012","Great customer service prior to buy service, great service in 'novice questions', very patient, I feel important here! The excellent customer service and technical skills are the best attributes of these people! Gigapros has stable and fast servers. They have nice 1-click installer scripts - they are very convenient. Also, chat online services are always available. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Migel Cordosa,"Wednesday, July 11, 2012","I have a small business website hosted on Gigapros, as well as my email. I got the unlimited bandwidth and diskspace promotion at a very cheap price for the first year, with a discount, and I'll sign up for a long time when I need to renew. The main thing is really the SSH access. I've enjoyed their service and their unrivaled transparency. When things go wrong, they explain what's happening and what they're doing to fix it and prevent it in future. Can't say anything bad about their customer service. They're cheap, bandwidth is plenty and domains unlimited but you get what you pay for; a slow and unusable website."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Manuel Lopes,"Monday, July 9, 2012","The tech support is great, truly speedy response from them with any problems I've had due to my inabilities.

Their technical support is outstanding - support tickets tend to get a response within minutes, which usually resolves the problem. I usually don't recommend companies but you should 100% go with Gigapros web host. "
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Andros Karadinis,"Wednesday, June 27, 2012","Gigapros has been a great webhost for me. I've had no site downtime other than me taking the site down to re-build or revamp, but that's of my doing. Most of my problems are answered very quickly. Pricing is more than fair - I really can't figure out how they manage to maintain such quality at those prices. They also keep introducing new plans that offer more for less money. All in all, I have to give Gigapros a perfect 100% on my grading scale for their surpassed reliability, stability, performance, and excellent customer support."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ernesto Laporta,"Monday, June 25, 2012","Thanks Gigapros web host! It's been 7 months and no downtime.

No problems with downtime. During almost 7 months my site never was down for more than a few minutes. Online support always available, very helpful, kind and above all quick!

I contacted their support and told them my requirements. They replied very fast and were very polite with me and explained everything I needed to know. After 10 minutes passed they found a good VPS fit for my needs. All I can say about their support is that they responded to my queries in double quick time with help I could use and easily understand.  The tools provided are great, but for the prices they charge more could be offered.Pricing is so to say reasonable. You get what you pay for. Servers are stable. I am fully satisfied using their VPS hosting service and can highly recommend them to any webmaster who is looking for quality and professional hosting services."

I'd particularly like to note their customer support which is extraordinary - I've had problems responded to and fixed within one or two hours around 3am. In addition to tickets which are handled quickly there's also Live Chat which I've found convinient... Gigapros hosting service is Perfect! Highly recommend them. 
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Thor Vaikonen,"Monday, June 11, 2012","While new to Gigapros, I feel like I have hit the ground running in setting up my website. Tutorial videos are always a good idea, but only when done effectively and well. Their videos are just that. I look forward to working with Gigapros and, while only signed up for a year of hosting, I can easily see myself renewing when the time comes. Highly recommend this decent web host."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Otto Kelersson,"Friday, June 8, 2012","I'm really happy with their support, they reply to support queries very quickly. Pricing is also good enough. They lack in some default features that come with reseller hosting generally, but innovative other features such as global hosted servers is always plus. I rate 8 out of 10 to Gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Eduardo Corado,"Thursday, June 7, 2012","The thing that I have been most impressed with during my time with Gigapros is their Customer support.

Once you experience the quality and professionalism of gigapros you would not go anywhere else for your webhosting."
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Jose Forlan,"Monday, June 4, 2012","I have had a website for a long time but only since I'm with Gigapros I've been 100% happy with my hosting company. Their support team made the transfer so smooth and my services were never greater! Moreover, real people answering real phones and having honest to goodness conversations with you about your situation. Downtime is rarely seen compared to my previous host. They are professionals and I am fully-satisfied customer.They used to be a solid hosting company - affordable pricing, good uptime and features - but the servers have become interminably slow over the last few months, particularly for sites that use MySQL databases. The move to Gigapros was a win-win for me. Better service and better value.  Great web hosting company, I highly recommend for just about anyone."

I recommend Gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Colin Maden,"Wednesday, May 30, 2012","I have been using gigapros for over 9 months. It has been great and server uptime is perfect. I love the features they provide although I wish they had a slightly better domain manager like the one you find on other host providers but that is all I can think of. Everything else has been superb and the privacy and security is excellent.24/7/365 live chat support has proven very useful for me and all requests have been dealt with very fast. Great job Gigapros!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Ed,"Tuesday, May 29, 2012","Our site has been down for 5 days. We emailed and called so many times and they can't simply replace a drive with a backup so our site is up.  They have really been a bad choice for us.  And no one will get on the phone with us that has the power to escalate this as a priority,  I have never heard of a site down for 5 days before.  Would never recommend this company"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Kinan Mighk,"Monday, May 28, 2012","Overall, Gigapros is a great host that I would recommend them. My site is always up and running. When I updated my site, changes were immediately noticeable. The Control Panel, being well-organized and user-friendly, is easy to navigate. The same goes for the File Manager and other sections of the CP. Diskspace and Bandwidth are also good. It is a solid hosting provider whose entry-level services can scale according to your needs."

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Silvio Benatorre,"Monday, May 14, 2012","I am more than happy with Gigapros. Their phone support takes forever to get through to during the day but when I get there, each and every time (15 times now, and it keeps a detailed log of this in your admin), they provide extremely detailed and accurate help. They did the backups and transfers until the old host finally made a good copy that was usable. They spent about a week just to get my sites all moved and running correct. If you want that personalized service then this is the place. keep up the good work!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Michael Bates,"Thursday, May 10, 2012","If you are like me and have to set up your MySQL databases for different scripts, then look no further than Gigapros. They have a very large selection of scripts to choose from. The crazy part is that I get support responses in HOURS, not days. Most of my questions are answered in less than 4 hours, which is fantastic. One thing that attracts me is also their pricing. Its very cheap compare to other hosts and they also give some interesting discount rates. Gigapros is the best host!"
GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Thomas Schwarz,"Monday, May 7, 2012",Fully-satisfied using Gigapros hosting service. The only thing I would like to change is the bill from monthly to yearly.

GigaPros,www.gigapros.com,Mirca Polvecku,"Friday, April 27, 2012","I would like to express the point that Gigapros has made my life so much easier and I don't really know where to begin. Suffice it to say that these guys are setting new standards in web hosting and in my opinion are the model for what every other hosting company should strive for. Now I've had 100% uptime with them, had all (slight) issues ironed out pretty quickly over the phone with their toll-free support and/or through their online tickets, and although I have never managed a server before, it wasn't rocket science. Speed is good, and the price isn't bad at all. Especially considering I never have to worry about unplanned server upgrades & PHP changes affecting my clients' websites. Overall, I'm very satisfied."

Codero,www.codero.com/,aamir,"Tuesday, June 21, 2016","Buyers BEWARE Their employees are rude and if you get upset because of their screw ups, they will ask you to leave. Take my advise, you will never hear something like this from other  nothing favorable if something goes wrongthey will sell your houseI am a professional with 25 years of experience. And i still host with this companyThey run the company like Mom and Pop and they do not care about when they create irate customers because of their low end service So many problems with them. I was lied to so many times. Its very difficult to detect a hosting company if they upgrade yoru server, and if that really happened.  Some problems:Codera is always a whole fiascoi have lost 4 clients in one day with them. Paid them to fix things but they didn't and lied to meI have been with these guys for more than decade and halfits unbelievable how my tasks has been handledThese guys did nothing, I contracted them to migrate my server, because they never upgraded and lied to me. So server got old and drive died, even when i paid them to upgrade. How can you work with someone like that.  They did things without discussing with me, installed plesk with full of errors, I reported all the errors. There was no one who took initiative on their end to fix things.  I fixed everything myselfI am extremely disappointed with thier service. Plus I upgraded my server two years ago and it turn out to be that you failed to do that.They lied to me that you upgraded, it was never upgraded, server has not been upgraded till 2011. They have reiterated that so many times in our conversation and itsd so convoluting to know that I was lied to. When I restored server with themthey have not fixed my cron jobs - migration had not done correctlydatabases not handled properlyusers not created for databases correctly  I had to do everything myself. Even when I created everything myself you failed to follow upThey kept insisting to keep everything in one ticket, because their performce is based on how many tickets that are open. Since all the 100s of issues were in one ticket, all my concerns were ignored.They did nothingEven domains not configured correctly.I mean worse service and too many people doing everything wrong whatever i restored myself, They overwritten it with bugs again three times, and i had to do all the work again THREE Times. God forbid, if i get in this situation again, Codero will screw everything up AGAIN DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY, FIND A BIG COMPANY. MOM AND POP COMPANIES ARE NOT FOR SMALL, MEDIUM AND ESPECIALLY NOT FOR BIG COMPANIES. "

I had enquired about their hosting when my other provider could not handle the site bandwidth. And also the customer service with the other provider was dwindling since they got bigger. I had a managed server now its a non managed dedicated server since I did not need the managed server support. However, they were able to reflect a few upgrades for me to compensate for the removal of the managed support costs. So I still pay the same price just my system got better core features. I virtually never need to contact them for any reason or anything else but when I do have to contact them they are always very prompt and helpful to fix or help me with an issue I might have. "

Honestly, it was as though I was speaking one language and the tech support person was speaking another. This was INCREDIBLY frustrating. I spent roughly 5-6 weeks trying to get my new site back up after my previous site had been lost to the public domain. However, once connected with Byron Biggs, ALL CHANGED!  Byron LISTENED, UNDERSTOOD and then ADDRESSED! He was patient, professional, friendly and incredibly knowledgeable, troubleshooting from every which way to get the problem resolved. STELLAR customer service! AIT should really look at how Byron handles customer service resolution issues and follow his lead.  I was ready to take my domain elsewhere, but Byron saved the account and as long as I now can speak with him, I remain confident that any issues I have in the future can and will be resolved. My thanks to Byron Biggs!  He's my hero, indeed!"
AIT,www.AIT.com,Jon Robson,"Monday, September 9, 2013",I have used AIT for about 15 years. I have found them to be responsive and professional. They are small enough to give me personalized responses and large enough to meet all my client's hosting needs. Would recommend.

Their customer service is prompt and efficient making it easy for me to focus on my business without having to worry about the web infrastructure. I would recommend AIT equally to a Start-Up Business and an Enterprise Business as their staff and engineers have the technical ability to support any kind of client.
Psychz Networks,www.psychz.net,Larry,"Wednesday, September 30, 2015",Psychz has come a long way and today they seem to be focused more on enterprise customers.  Their network has evolved to the point with 0 faults.  Each POP that they open provides great latency along with free ddos protection.  Their prices are competitive but what makes them stand out is the features.  Their edge layer tools allow me to control all traffic that is going inbound or outbound.  Plus they have a handy ddos tool that lets you view live attacks.  
Psychz Networks,www.psychz.net,JR,"Wednesday, July 15, 2015",I have experienced repeated hacking against my computers from the Psychz Networks trying to break the administrators password.  Not sure how you can trust a company that does this.

I rarely have to wait for a long time when facing issues with the service.  I am mainly with them for their fast support.

They set up my dedicated server in a heartbeat, provided superb support via their online ticketing system, email and via Skype. I wouldn't say I'm a needy customer, but the initial setup of the gigabit port, etc took a little guidance. Once it was done, everything has been smooth. Good uptime, flawless connection, so far. The dedi is in the Netherlands and I got a VPS in Russia for a backup nameserver. The connection to both servers from Taiwan is outstanding, and between themselves - Russia to Netherlands, is unbelievable. Maybe it sounds too good to be true, but so far - I'm very pleased. Hands down, best hosting provider I've been with."

ReliableSite,www.reliablesite.net,Josh Brody,"Tuesday, February 19, 2013","I love ReliableSite. I went from a few others and ended up with ReliableSite. The service I received is impeccable. The team are great. They'll make sure you're accommodated, happy, and will make you a great deal. Just go with them. Seriously. I once needed four OS re-installs in a row. They did it and refused to bill me for it."
ReliableSite,www.reliablesite.net,Dan Joseph,"Saturday, October 29, 2011","They say the customer is #1, yet every time I've had to put a ticket in, its been 3-4 more e-mails before they even half fix it.  Their owner has a ""leave us alone"" approach to handling customers, and hides behind his e-mail, rather than trying to fix the problem and communicate with his customers.  They also state they are devoted to complete professionalism.  I'd call them crooks instead."
Hivelocity,www.hivelocity.net/,David,"Friday, March 22, 2013",This hosting is very stable and the price is nice. The support is impressive. I have 4 servers with 100% availability.
Hivelocity,www.hivelocity.net/,Tned BroncosForums,"Tuesday, November 20, 2012","I have been with Hivelocity for three or four years now. I currently have two servers with them.  I have upgraded my primary server three different times, as the traffic to my site and site needs have grown. Each time I have investigated other options just to make sure I was making an informed decision. However, in the end, after doing that investigation, and also having discussions with the team. I have opted to order the new upgraded server with Hivelocity. Recently they have begun offering fully managed Cpanel options. It has proven to be a cost effective and very good option. I have total confidence in Hivelocity and if I was making a decision to purchase a new server today, Hivelocity is the company I would go with again. Just like the two servers I currently have with them. "
Hivelocity,www.hivelocity.net/,Brennan,"Monday, November 19, 2012","After years of swapping providers due to terrible product quality or customer service, I stumbled upon Hivelocity. Within 15 minutes, a custom quote was provided to suit my needs over their live chat without hassle. Codero, a competitor, was unable to match the price and specifications offered by Hivelocity during my comparative search. Although an account manager seemed to use a recycled ""personalized"" email to express the perks of the datacentre during his sales pitch, not once did I feel as if my business didn't matter to them. A file corruption issue (caused by a script installed by me) created a completely unusable environment. I submitted a low priority reload request and went to sleep. I woke up with exactly what I asked for. Bottom line? The hardware, customer service, and overall quality of Hivelocity is impressive. You'd be crazy not to deploy your next server with them, I know I will."

The customer interface is intuitive and easy to navigate and the back end administration and editing features are easy and quick with great features like bulk uploading and editing.

I had to make another payment to get reinstated.  They were real quick to debit my bank acct. but very slow to pay a blll which was due 3 days after my acct was debited.  On their site under my acct. it says the bill was paid 4 days ago.  Very poor service; cannot be trusted to pay bills on time.
doxo,www.doxo.com,BJaM,"Monday, October 13, 2014",Be very careful using this for paying your bills because they take your money out of your checking account weeks before your bill is due. Bill due 27th took money 10th and with no money in my account because it was not legally DUE. This is Fraud.

Its support team is highly knowledgeable and constantly alert for replies, they assisted me in using the API and the importation tools in order to quickly import documents to the database. I have implemented FileHold for the telecom sector and for the oil and gas, in the oil and gas we required many metadata fields which is a good feature in FileHold to allow for advanced searching. Document linking also was very useful. I have experienced another EDMS before, and would highly recommend FileHold."

DomainZaar,www.domainzaar.com,Toni,"Thursday, September 4, 2014","This is one intuitive piece of software. I am extremely happy with my purchase and I would give both the script and customer support 5 stars. I have over 1000 domains. Now as most people know you can simply park your domains in places like GoDaddy but it is quite worthless. Years ago, it was worth something. Today, Google penalizes you and you receive very little in Ad Sense commissions if you choose to do this. With this software you can easily park your domains and google sees each and every domain as a unique site and does not know that it is parked. That alone makes this a great choice. However I was using Wordpress to make separate pages for each of my domains rather than Park them. It was extremely time consuming. With this software I can make Wordpress type pages in less than 1/5 of the time. I don't have to install Wordpress for each and every application. Once the software is installed I can add a domain and customize it to be a unique page in literally seconds. If I want to add content outside of Googe Adsense I can simply use the RSS feeds option and have fresh content updated daily. I can also post my own blogs and content using their custom HTML editor and simply ""add a module"" at the click of a button. The interface was well thought out and is extremely easy to use. I have created an entire website, using this script, with different content on each page quickly and easily. It may not have the all plugins that WordPress has, but the modules I need are there and I don't have to install them each and everytime like I do with WordPress. If you are like me and have multiple domains then this is the best option on the market and a great alternative to Wordpress. Another great application for this software is its ability to interface with affiliate marketing programs like click bank. I have made over 30 clickbank domains using this software... In short, I can't say enough good things about this software and am extremely happy with my purchase. I highly recommend it."
GoDaddy.com,www.godaddy.com,Stephan,"Monday, August 11, 2014",They are ok for small static site hosting but some of their servers are crammed with 150  website which totally slows down the access time.

Not only is the staff extremely responsive, but they are problem solvers who give positive insight throughout the development process. We originally were on Magento and there is a night and day difference in the ease of use on Upshot's platform verses Magento. We are so much happier and glad we made the change despite our fears of it being a challenge. They made it painless. We also had quite a few customizable requirements and they were able to perform all of them. I would highly recommend Upshot Commerce. "

Upshot Commerce,www.upshotcommerce.com,Steve Sheiner,"Wednesday, March 18, 2015","For a number of years I ran the ecommerce portion of my business using freelance developers to build and maintain my site. And for the most part it worked until my independent contractor let me know that hed been offered a full time job and Id need to replace him. Id been through that exercise a couple of times over the years and I knew how hard it would be to find a reliable replacement. It was time to refresh my site so this time, instead of hiring a freelance team, I went looking for a SAAS solution. After looking at a number of companies I chose Upshot Commerce. Because theyre in the business of providing ecommerce sites they already had all the features that I felt were important and unlike hiring a free lance developer I didnt have to worry that my projects are put on the back burner or ignored because another project takes precedence. Besides great service, a responsive team and a very simple UI what I like the most is not having to worry if my site is down or something isnt working. The Upshot Commerce platform seamlessly integrates with our 3PL , giving us an accurate an central system of record across all our channels."
Upshot Commerce,www.upshotcommerce.com,Kate Vick,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","Weve worked with Upshot Commerce for 10  years and transitioned to their current platform in November 2013 and have been thrilled with the result. The design and implementation was challenging and a lot of work on our part but the new system has been transformative. Our sales for January (our busiest month of the year) were are up over 30% from last year. Again, not all due to US but the new system is certainly a factor. And more importantly, we handled the growth with almost no new staff."

Upshot Commerce,www.upshotcommerce.com,Jason Oliver,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","Upshot Commerce is a platform that I have worked with for over a decade. I've actually started a number of companies on it. For the value, you get the most features of any platform out there. Most platforms don't even include half their features, like a loyalty program or gift wrapping module, for example. It also has an extensive order management platform, that every time we considered a different product for just that feature, it never compared on features and was always more than the entire system.  I don't think its the right product for very small businesses, its for medium to large businesses. "

Upshot Commerce,www.upshotcommerce.com,Dave Anderson,"Friday, March 13, 2015","Worst decision of my business career working with Upshot Commerce.  Cost me a year of business.  Platform did not work, email system was non-existent, drop-ship communication was so bad it was like they had not heard of drop shipping, checkout was so pitiful that our customers of years were calling us complaining and ordering over the phone.  I hope this will help you not lose hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Find a platform that truly does what they say it does....there are great ones out there.   Not this one.  Please feel free to contact me personally for specifics, as I have hundreds."

Customers should be able to designing their own sign. We had a lot of wishes and requirements. One of the requirements was a product designer that was compatible with full vector files. We ended up at the HTML product designer of Design n Buy. This Magento module contains a large number of functionalities that we needed. They were also able to build the customized functionalities we needed. Currently were implementing the software they build for us. I 'm very satisfied about the way they communicate.  Although the distance between India and the Netherland, communication was no problem at all. The project manager and sales manager kept contact with us when necessary. Questions were answered quickly. They have a lot of experience in HTML, PHP and HTML They ware able to build everything we needed regarding our wishes. Complex solutions were not a problem. They even solved problems with our webhosting partner.I can recommend this company anyone who is looking for a product designer. But before you start think about a few things to avoid problems later. So think about functionalities and the look and feel. Keep in mind that everything takes longer than expected.Bram Sluiterhttp://naambordencentrale.nl"

We can't thank Transform Agency enough.
Transform Agency,www.transformagency.com,Jennifer T,"Friday, November 23, 2012","I recently launched an apparel website, which had been a dream of mine for a long time. I started out with very little knowledge about e-commerce. I had a modest budget and found the technical aspects of e-commerce rather intimidating. I felt confident about the design (having come from a design background). But I was aware of a large gap in knowledge when it came to how to process orders, take credit cards, do search engine marketing, hosting and other technical stuff. From the sales phase through to the project development, the final delivery and launch of my website, I really appreciated the friendly and detailed support I got. The work was high quality which I had expected, but the support was really outstanding.

FastSpring,www.fastspring.com/,Davor,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","FastSpring is the online merchant we've been using for our software product since 2011 and I'm very happy with it. The UI for the account administrator is somewhat old school but it is robust and has had all the features we've needed so far. Most important though is that FS handles all the different ways of payment and things like VATs and refunds and referral fee splitting etc., ie. they've made it simple and easy for money to move between the parties involved while taking care of all the details. And also as the other review says the customer service is top-notch."

Its got all the functionality you need to avoid spending any significant development time, unlike a lot of other more basic solutions. And their customer service is outstanding - unlike anything I've experienced with other e-commerce vendors. I can see why they have such a happy and diverse user base. Very strongly recommended."

CrazyLister,www.crazylister.com,Robin,"Wednesday, March 23, 2016","I've been designing ebay templates and related graphics for eBay sellers in the past 4 years.Until CrazyLister came along I've been using Photoshop and html but as a graphic designer CrazyLister made my life much easier and from what I've seen it actually allows non savvy people create very good designs on their own, this is definitely the easiest way to design eBay listings from all the tools I've been using so far."

Keen Print,www.keenprint.com,Jack holmbeck,"Tuesday, November 18, 2014","They refuse to answer questions, constantly guide you down roads already traveled, and basically do not have a product to sell that matched the one that they are now marketing.  Their marketing spiel sounds really good, however, when you buy the product, they suddenly cannot speak English, and cannot answer questions.  They are really towing the line on things and I would definitely ask to see working  examples that are in use before trusting them that they have it.  Also, their back end software and some of their advanced software features are really sort of neat - but if you buy, you will be left holding the bag and not able to deploy any site at all....there are MAJOR issues with them having WEB-2-PRINT software.  IT appears that that they had a B2B business software model and used some homegrown software effectively, and decided to form a company and sell it under the name of Keen Software.  Well, let me tell you, that they are the masters of not answering questions, hiding behind their shortcomings and never will admit anything.   IT is unbelieveable how they had from the questions.  You ask them what features tell the user to either upload or design, and they will tell you the driving directions from Miami to Oakland.  They are unreal, and I am not sure what country they are from, but, raisign money with VC must be their only true skill - because business in the USA and being truthful is sure not a skill they have.   I actually find them quite dishonest and covering up for some advance conceptions that they may have a marketable product soon - but, they don't and they just hide behind anything they can to get around it.  I doubt that they ever will have a fordable product. Jack HolmbeckCW Print ServicesAustin, TX"

Be careful locking into this platform, as they seem to change their policies to suit their current financial needs."

Id suggest this marketing platform to anyone who is willing to build email lists or want to send bulk emails to their subscribers list. Ininbox also offers a free account where you can test the quality of the mailing and the statistics of your email marketing campaign."

DirectIQ,www.directiq.com,Ekim Kaya,"Monday, August 11, 2014","I've signed up with other services in the past, but was harassed on the phone and through email by their customer service and account reps which was quite frustrating (they were a lot like that annoying waiter at a restaurant that stops by 15 times to ""make sure you're alright"" to a point that it bothers and disrupts you). Though, when I signed up for DirectIQ's free trial, I was surprised and relieved to find that I didn't have to provide my phone number, and that my inbox wasn't fed with emails inquiring about getting me started with a paid version. Rather, they sent me one email when I signed up for the free trial, and then one more a month later that told me my trial was over and asked if I wanted to upgrade - that's it, thank god! Plus, they're cheaper than other email marketing firms which is great."

I highly recommend it to everyone - but in particular, to people that are just beginning to dip there feet into the email marketing waters.

They don't go on forever, but rather, are pretty succinct and to the point. I'm thinking about starting a newsletter, so it's nice knowing that the DirectIQ support staff is available 24/7 to help me whenever I need... Their description says that they cater to small to medium size businesses, and you can really tell how important it is to them to build and maintain relationships with their customers, just a really pleasant customer support experience overall. And, for someone like me that's just starting out, their 'Email Marketing News' blog is really helpful. Looking forward to building my contact list and getting my newsletter/email marketing efforts rolling! "
GloboMailer,www.globomailer.com,Dan F,"Tuesday, August 9, 2016","I have been using GloboMailer for over a 4 months now and I must say it is outstanding. The features offered are unlike any other ESP I have used in the past... Also, something really important to me is user friendliness and GloboMailer is extremely user friendly. Plus, setting up the account was a breeze... I have tried many Email Service Providers who have so many steps in the process its not even worth signing up. With GloboMailer I was up and running within the same day... From import process to sending... it was so easy! And most importantly  the deliverability is superb! With all this combined and price point being exactly what I was looking to pay I honestly cant say anything I dislike about GloboMailer.

Campaigner,www.campaigner.com,J Yost,"Tuesday, February 17, 2015","The site and its reports are easy to use and read. It is the call-in and email customer service that desperately needs help.  We get canned, irrelevant replies to any of our inquiries to problems that should not even pop up by using the site. You must email, since their ""Chat"" option is hardly ever available. Even after sending screenshots and explicitly detailed accounts of problems, their support is still unable to answer simple stuff, like ""Why does my contact list not upload?"" or ""Why won't my test email go through?"" Then, to make matters even worse, Campaigner will inexplicably ""lock"" your account's contact list, rendering it unusable until they they get around to resolving this additional problem. I will no longer use Campaigner because all of the time and my client's time that has been wasted on a simple email blast."
Campaigner,www.campaigner.com,Joe Gresham,"Thursday, September 5, 2013",Campaigner - j2 Global has been the absolute best way to consolidate all of my contacts and distribute emails and email updates to customers.

I'm used to speaking to companies and being put on the back burner. I mean, I run a small clothing company in Montreal and I don't represent much to most companies. BUT, when dealing with Elite Email, they treat me like I've never been treated before. Their customer service department is just incredible! They are patient, caring and extremely knowledgeable.  They take time to help me no matter how big or small my problem is. They give me advice and have always been there when I needed them. I can't say that about many companies.  The system is straight forward and simple to use. It's priced wonderfully and I can honestly say it has been a pleasure working with them for the last  few months. What an awesome company. I'd recommend them any day of the week! If you want to deal with a company that actually cares about it's customers, then Elite Email is where you should do your email and mobile marketing. "

I do equipment leasing, and after spending a few hours setting everything up, creating my email, I sent it, but they reviewed it and said that their server cannot handle this type of content. They come across as this friendly, easy to use site, but in reality, they have more restrictions than most. Would NOT recommend this site to anyone, there are plenty of options out there."

Nor will I forward chain letters, petitions, mass mailings, or virus warnings to large numbers of others. This is my contribution to the survival of the online community.

The design even makes my wife to use the tool with ease. The dashboard of the staff rota app contains many at-a-glance pieces of information, including the current days schedules hourly layout. The dashboard is well designed to ensure that the novice user makes use of the numerous time-saving features and tools to his or her advantage.This really impressed me because my wife was not a tech geek in any way. She was able to get along with the use without the need to be calling the customer support department of the manufacturer all the time. She can easily make the employee scheduling software to what she wants, from the daily, weekly and monthly scheduling options to the shift-trade and time-off requests section to all the kinds of reports that can be generated.

DATASTOR,www.datastor.com,Martyn,"Thursday, May 15, 2014","I like many others I guess, I  have tried different backup products, most have been OK but some pretty bad. The real test is on a full restore and most are woefully inadequate. I was introduced to Datastor by a friend, he claimed the product deduplicated the data, meaning if the file or part of was already backed up, it only referenced the already moved data. On first use I was unimpressed with the speed and gave up with it. That was a big mistake, whilst not slow the first pass/backup was not fast either. It came into its own on subsequent backups, a full 12GB in 1min 8 seconds, 1.8Tb in less than 30 mins. If you have more than one PC it uses that already backed up data as a reference so to speak and a second PC backup with 1.2Gb of data only passed over 116Mb data on the first backup. So to summerise, it only backs up changed files and only parts of so it is super fast. It is also the only product that has done a BMR seamlessly so it gets a full 5 stars from me. BTW I introduced it to my companies IT department and they are to be moving over to it when an existing support contract runs out on their existing product. "
Unanet,Write a review,Cory McTonic,"Thursday, July 9, 2015","Our experience with Unanet has been excellent.  We are using it to support a DCAA auditable accounting and financial practice and it is working quite well.  Its flexibility as to the setup and configuration at the user interface level is outstanding.  It truly allows us to create our company policies and procedures and tailor Unanet to those and not vice versa.It is a lightweight interface that is intuitive and well designed.  It includes the ability to configure user roles for everyone from a basic timesheet or expense user to a Controller or CFO that oversees the entire financial operation of the business.  We have especially enjoyed its ability to export financial data to CSV files, be able to manipulate those exports, and import them into payroll systems, accounting systems, and more.  Moreover, it is scalable and cost effective.  It allows you to setup an operation for a startup company and scale it accordingly, including costs, as you grow.  It is a 100% tailorable and lightweight ERP.  It can implement as little or as much rigor as you desire into your finance and accounting operations.  We are excited to further understand and eventually implement Unanet financial as it seems to be on a strong trajectory in its early stages.It is a great product that we highly recommend!"

The third party support which is very expensive, (hundreds of dollars per hour), are too busy to give proper customer service. So dont buy it other software companies can do the same thing, (netsuite is huge you dont need all of its components). Also if your company grows to more than ten nusers they raise the price on an already expensive investment. So if you are a small company think twice about purchasing NetSuite it is a lonely expensive program. "
NetSuite,www.NetSuite.com,"Michael W. Gebert, CMA","Friday, May 22, 2015","Customer service is painful.  Good luck navigating through the telephone menu structure.  Get ready to be told you selected the wrong item and you get put at the back of the line for the correct selection.  Then its not likely they will have an answer for you.  Maybe you'll have an answer in 24 hours.  Account management not helpful.  Finally, the system uses archane terminology and lacks certain basic financial controls.  Trying to set up workflow will require a specialist and probably more cost.  Customizing reports...good luck.  We're moving to something else just to avoid the pain we've been through."

NetSuite,www.NetSuite.com,Hailey,"Wednesday, November 12, 2014","NetSuite is a great fully-integrated tool if you are a retailer or manufacturing organization. Be careful of the sales demonstrations as their top talent designs demo versions based on your company needs. Once you sign the contract, it all goes downhill fast. Their implementation team is not proficient in their own system and can only offer text book answers. Their professional services is unrealistic in cost and you cannot verify if they actually developed the programming that you need at the overly-inflated charges or if they just clicked a button to enable a feature. If you do proceed with NetSuite, find a 3rd party consultant with Certifications in HTML and SQL. It will save you tens of thousands of dollars and you will ensure you get what you need. There are also 3rd party companies that specialize solely with the implementation of NetSuite.  When completing a vendor evaluation, make sure you see the ""out of the box"" reports and they are laid out and presented exactly how you need. The only report out of the box that worked for me was the balance sheet. "

We spent countless hours in re-entering data in 3 of these systems - these problems magically disappeared when WorkBook contacted me. Yes I have had to pay a little extra than I was currently paying but the time, money and effort that I am now saving every week is astounding. I am now using all areas of WorkBook (CRM, Project Management, Resource Management   full Accounting system) providing me with a true overview of expected revenue, project progression and resource capacity, just to mention a few advantages.

Inspect this is the only facility management tool that puts both inspections and corrective actions as well as inventory management in one package.  The only down side is that it is not cheap.

HouseCall Pro,Write a review,Kenneth Nicholas,"Thursday, January 14, 2016","For 18 months we were looking for a software that could do three things:1. Manage our customer database (CRM)2. Schedule appointments and send automatic reminders to customers (Appointment Scheduling)3. Assign and dispatch employees to jobs (Field Service Management)It seemed every software was designed to do one, MAYBE TWO, of these things, but no software could do all three. Then we found HouseCall Pro. It seemed almost too good to be true, but HouseCall does it all for us. We haven't looked back.Here are the PROs:1. App for field technicians is awesome! Best I've seen. 2. Strong and powerful integration with Google -- autofills addresses and integrates with Maps. 3. Automatic e-mail reminders sent to customers. 4. Postcard marketing campaigns. 5. Quickbooks compatible. 6. Incomparable customer service. They have a friendly, helpful and intelligent group of people working for them. They are always there to listen to requests and solve problems. The messaging app within the desktop software lets you communicate with them directly anytime. They always seem to respond within mere minutes.7. They are constantly releasing updates and improvements to the software. It gets better with every release and it shows they really listen to customer suggestions!We've learned that no software is perfect. HouseCall Pro is pretty darn close, though! Here are the CONS:1. The schedule view is hard to read and use. When you are trying to get an overview of your resources and availability, you have to scroll left/right as well as up/down. It's made it hard for us, so we still have to rely on Google Calendar to view employee availability when trying to schedule jobs.2. No automatic reminders sent to employees. There is a push notification one hour before a job starts, but this is not enough time for us. We want an email or test least a day, even a week, in advance.3. Few customization options. (eg - You cannot rename ""professional"" to ""stylist"" or ""technician"" to suit your industry.) You can't include hyperlinks in follow-up emails to link customers to a satisfaction survey. (They have to copy/paste the address into the browser.)4. No way to ""black out"" dates on scheduler for employee time off. Again, we still have to use Google Calendar. Although they just released ""Non-Job Events"" and this could serve as a possible workaround for us. We are looking into it!5. The CRM is weak. (No multiple contacts for a business, no way to name different service addresses, no pipeline for making sales, etc.)All that being said, the pros outweigh the cons. We love HouseCall Pro. It was the best move we ever made and has allowed us to grow and expand our business. Highest recommendations!!! Thanks, HouseCall!"
HouseCall Pro,Write a review,Alexander Cronin-Scott,"Tuesday, January 12, 2016","The best part about this software is that it is cloud-based making it available where ever you go.

No more daily calendars for the crew. It's all on their phone. They can make changes on site and make sure the customer is charged correctly. Credit card processing is easy and I love that I get an email alert when clients pay. The ability to send quotes and get alerted if/when the customer accepts or declines is great for streamlining our process.The GPS tracking is wonderful. Now I know where my guys are and I don't have to bother them with a phone call."

We used to use a mix of QB, Google Calendar, email invoicing and Square for CC payments but now HouseCall has replaced them all. It's great with the automatic reminders and notifications by text/email and automated follow up thank you cards. It's worth every penny."
HouseCall Pro,Write a review,Audrey Hernandez,"Tuesday, October 27, 2015","Love this company! it makes scheduling a lot easier and also helps me keep in touch with our clients.

If you are in services its a must!! keep track of your ROI , go paperless and invoice via email. send notifications when you are on route. All i can say is try there free demo!! you will fall in love with housecall. Oh did i mention there customer service is outstanding.

Jobber,www.getjobber.com,Kingreen,"Monday, April 29, 2013","Before we found Jobber we used 3 different platforms to do our scheduling, billing, and visit reporting. It took a few extra hours to get all our customers put in and their jobs created in the system but it was well worth the time. We had looked into other solutions to no avail. Either they were way too expensive or just weren't what we needed. Jobber is simple and combines scheduling, job reporting, and invoicing all in one. You can also track your income progress throughout the year. They continue to add new features consistently which is a huge plus. It's a wonderful system and I would recommend it to any service professional.  "

It keeps track of techs, invoices, parts, dispatching,  payroll and recievables. Its so nice to have all this at a glance no matter where I am.

The level of customer service we have received is top notch!! They also customized the product to suit our individual needs. We can schedule work, manage invoices and maintain notes all in one place. It is super user friendly; I can train all persons on the basics in minutes! The 3 biggest benefits of using this software 1. Details, I can find out everything I need to know about a customer at a glance, as well as dig in to find the complete history 2. Ease of use  training is easy for even the technologically disadvantaged 3. Customizations... We dont fit into a cookie cutter, and needed specific things from this software. The customizations we purchased have made our lives soooo much easier!! I would definitely recommend Routepoint to any service company out there!!"""
GeoOp,geoop.com,Daniel Roberts,"Friday, April 1, 2016",I used this software in the last business I worked for and it was brilliant. We transitioned from madness in the office to streamlined processes that made everyone's lives easier. The guys out on the field picked it up after being open minded to change and it was a game changer. If I am ever back working with a mobile team this software will be adopted in a heartbeat.
GeoOp,geoop.com,Peter,"Wednesday, September 16, 2015",I've used GeoOp for about a year and find it fantastic and easy for everyone in the company to use. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending GeoOp to other businesses.
GeoOp,geoop.com,Margarita Elevancini,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","Prior to starting with Geo op we were really struggling to manage our business using fragmented and outdated systems to try an manage our scheduling of jobs, contractors, customer information and invoicing. We literally hit a stage were we couldn't grow any bigger as it was taking all out time 7 days a week just to manage the jobs we had. We started using Geo op in April 2013 and it totally changed the way we were able to manage our business. Within 6 months we managed to double the number of customers we have and double the size of our Monthly turnover. Plus we now spend approx 20 hours a week less time on the administration and management of our business compared to when we operated without Geo op and half the number of customers. To achieve those sort of results in just 6 months is beyond our wildest expectations but without doubt it would not have been impossible without Geo op and the support they provided us to get the system up and running quickly. We now have a real growth plan and confidence that with Geo op we have the ability to double our business in size again and still be able to manage this growth. We would not hesitate to highly recommend any service related business get on board and start using Geo op and especially anyone just starting out in business to commence with Geo op from day one. It will be the best business tool you have."

The file management side is a serious strong point of Clinked, eg. various means of uploading multiple files, version control, instant viewing, integration with Google apps, work flow, etc. It also offers great abilities to discuss with other team members, either in direct connection to content, but also in general.

SmartFile,www.smartfile.com,NicholasGregory,"Wednesday, February 3, 2016","Prepaid SmartFile for 1 year. Was a waste of money. Customer service is poor, tickets were often closed without the questions within being answered.

SAP,www.sap.com,EcueD,"Friday, August 16, 2013",SAP Is a quite straight forward company that knows what it is doing and designs software around what you REALLY need and nothing more or less.

Cougar Mountain Software,www.cougarmtn.com,Williams,"Tuesday, July 8, 2014",CMS Pro was pretty good but we were encouraged to step-up to Denali. We did and have regretted it ever since. It s riddled with programming errors that you find after it has trashed your P and L and Balance sheet. The reports are inadequate and you have t be a CPA and programmer to navigate it. Sales and service people are good to work with which is nice but I would rather have a competent program. 
Cougar Mountain Software,www.cougarmtn.com,Midwest Acct,"Monday, February 24, 2014","Previously used their CMS Pro software and loved it, the new version (Denali), not so much.  The software has multiple issues most of which are programming errors that they fix with multiple service packs.  The  good thing is that the support people are pretty good to deal with...the bad is you will have to deal with them. The current program does not have a good payroll interface.  I understand a payroll solution is in the works.  "

h2desk,www.h2desk.com,Alex Misnovs,"Thursday, January 17, 2013","If you are looking for a reliable help desk software, look no further! We were looking for software what would be able to handle multiple websites support tickets in one place and tried h2desk. It was a great choice!  Having 6 merchant websites we can manage all our tickets in one place. System automatically imports emails for you and sends ticket notifications to your customer. There are things to be improved but in general software is great. What I would like to point out to the reader is the level and quality h2desk support team provide.  You can revert to them with any issue you have and one way or another your problem will be solved. Being a webmaster I know how important support is and h2desk sure have it! I would recommend h2desk to anyone who is looking for a long term reliable ticketing software with an outstanding support."
h2desk,www.h2desk.com,Jeff Kimbler,"Tuesday, December 25, 2012",We have several small businesses within our corporation.  Being able to manage all those sites with one service is wondeful.  We have eperienced a few difficulties with the techs but I am sure it was just miscommunication on both parts. 
h2desk,www.h2desk.com,John,"Friday, December 21, 2012",I highly recommend this website due to its website being very easy to navigate. The most important part is that this can really help your business with all the options it has!

h2desk,www.h2desk.com,afrunk,"Thursday, December 13, 2012","This is a great looking website and is easy to navigate. It has a lot of relative information and it is also aesthetically pleasing. However, there are a few things that don't make it perfect. Such as the fact that the ""pricing & signup"" link is always highlighted, no matter what page of the website you are on. "
h2desk,www.h2desk.com,Lucy,"Monday, December 10, 2012","h2desk took some puzzling over before it was up and running, but once it was things have been running more smoothly than ever before. With a little patience, this purchase will be well worth it."
h2desk,www.h2desk.com,William Sweet,"Tuesday, December 4, 2012","Horrible. I have been trying to configure this for our agency but I had a few questions before we purchased. I've been trying to contact them for 4 days!. I give up, I'll go with a different product that is more expensive so I know that if there is ever an issue, we wont have to go a week or more without being able to accept tickets. A customer service / ticketing system company that doesn't answer their own tickets. I've put in 3 so far."

h2desk,www.h2desk.com,Michael Postlethwait,"Friday, September 28, 2012","h2desk has been essential for our day to day business.  The product itself is constantly improving.  Due to budget restraints, we could not afford a ""zendesk"" type of helpdesk solution, and I couldn't be happier with h2desk.  I have demo'd several other products and this one had the most features and the best price.h2desk is always very helpful in terms of customer service.  I have submitted probably 20  tickets to their support team and every single issue has been addressed and resolved.I would highly recommend h2desk."

h2desk,www.h2desk.com,Pete Morgan,"Wednesday, September 19, 2012","I would like the option for phone support. Also, reporting is a bit weak in terms of metrics (length of time a ticket was open, avg opened/closed per week, level tracking so we can tell how many level 1, 2,  etc, tickets were opened). Overall, we have been very happy with the product and our clients have responded well to it."

ManageEngine,www.manageengine.com,Alessandro Fortunato,"Thursday, June 7, 2012",The application is very intuitive and easy to use. Customizing the application was cakewalk. The Admin Panel was so well organized and all we needed to do was click Start on the Configuration Wizard. The application guided us through the complete configuration process and we were ready to start working on tickets on Day 2 of our purchase. It took just 14 hours to get ServiceDesk Plus On-Demand up and running 100% and start managing our IT service desk.

versaSRS,www.versasrs.com,Florance N.,"Monday, August 5, 2013",versaSRS has been an invaluable resource for my company as a tool to track and log support requests. I'd recommend this product for anyone with a medium-sized company as a measurement tool. It's priceless.
versaSRS,www.versasrs.com,David Wentink,"Tuesday, June 25, 2013","versaSRS is designed around the way we work. We did not have to change the way we operate to fit the tool. For those few times we have gone outside the box, it has been flexible enough to customize resulting in a measurable improvement in our internal processes. We use it to log and track everything including service requests, sales opportunities, equipment orders, and new customer leads. It automatically notifies our purchasing department and our clients when warranty and maintenance renewals are due and tracks the entire process from quoting to invoicing, making sure nothing is missed. We are easily able to look up any contact, organization, asset, and all their related service history records within a few clicks. With its document management capabilities, versaSRS has even served as a very functional web-based paperless office system for our business.  With all this, we've only tapped a few of its features. Obviously, we highly recommend versaSRS for any business."
versaSRS,www.versasrs.com,Mike G,"Monday, June 24, 2013",versaSRS is a must have! I'm not sure what I did before to handle all my support requests!

Novo Solutions,www.novosolutions.com,Dhiraj Gadia,"Tuesday, May 1, 2012","Novo is value for money. We've been using it as an internal helpdesk tool for our consultants and also for our production support service line for our clients to submit helpdesk requests. There is some functionality desired that's not available, but for the price and simplicity of the tool, it has been very satisfying. Also, Novo comes with upgrades and enhancements where they try to accomodate functionality requests from clients which is definitely appreciated. The customer service I get from Brian Lu and Clark Tannner has been excellent and are always happy to help when needed."

Cayzu Help Desk,www.cayzu.com,Marc Shaffer,"Thursday, July 31, 2014","While we are relatively new to using the service, in the short time we have had it deployed it has worked perfectly and a poll of our Clients who used it was very positive. It provides the means to easily follow up on our tech tickets to assure a Client gets what they need quickly and efficiently. Now if we could just tie it into a phone system for Clients to set tickets that would be great and convenient.I know I should also comment about its down sides, but honestly so far, other than phone access, we have not found any.We will continue to deploy and will update this review should we find any negatives to report.Cayzu has been helpful in getting it all set up correctly and responsive to issues and questions.

The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Tony Cooper,"Monday, August 1, 2016",I am using tollfree numbers since 2010 and switched to TRP in 2012. I am confident that TRP is the best with the service. Call quality is good and customer service is available 24/7. Response time is very less and almost every issue has been resolved instantly.
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,pushpank,"Friday, July 29, 2016","Worst service I have ever seen. Agents over chat keep transferring the chat and the supervisors are never assisting the account. I wrote them email to to not to bill me from next month and they mis understood and closed my account without noticing that it had balance in it. Then they opened a new account again after escalating and again asking me for verification. On requesting for further help they mis behave with me and a unprofessional behavior was observed. I am unsatisfied."
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Sagar ,"Friday, July 15, 2016","I wanted to rate it negative if i can, this people are clearly cyber thieves. They have deducted Rs.40,000 from my account with out my notice. This was not the first time it happened, it happened multiple times .After multiple request and mails, they still deduct money without our notice. We are placing a cyber complaint on this people. It's not because we lost our money, its because of sarcastic replies from the support people,not only this,they don't even serve us better in any aspect which they promise. I strongly recommend not to go with this people at any cost. I personally lost one project because of their poor and useless service "

The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Kumar,"Thursday, October 29, 2015","Real PBX is the worst hosted PBX company I've worked with.

I have been a customer for half a year now and they have yet to disappoint. The calling is mostly uninterrupted but there have been a few incidents where there was voice breakage during the calls.

The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Lena Wood,"Wednesday, August 19, 2015","I decided to make a switch to RealPBX, after experiencing unsatisfactory services delivered by my previous provider. Its been more than 2 years with RealPBX and I am quite happy with the services.However, in the initial stage I faced few issues related to the setup and installation probably because I was well adjusted to the previous service provider.  But, their support proved to be an escape. I was not well-versed with the technicalities of the dialer but the support guys helped me to understand well its functionalities. They fixed up the things pretty well and delivered exactly how I wanted. "
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Nitesh,"Monday, July 6, 2015",Technically a bad company... just have had their services from 10 days and i had to face both technical and billing issue both... With only half the minutes i consumed they emailed me that I've over used the service and suspended my number without an intimation... and when i started a chat session with one of their rep he just had no answer to my questions... though he resumed the services stating that he is sorry for the inconvenience but the damage was done... lost my confidence in the services and the company...my suggestion... look for all the options before even thinking to get the services from this company.
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Elias Williams,"Tuesday, January 6, 2015",The features of  RealPBX looks great and convincing regardless of what its competitors are offering. I have tried other options as well but it is very clear In my mind as to why I am going for this one.
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Andrei Macsin,"Wednesday, December 24, 2014",SMBs can really try this solution as it is completely designed according to their expectations.

Its been a month since I signed up for Real PBXs service. Before signing up, I did tons of research on web, read reviews and compared it with other service providers.

The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Sai Mohit,"Friday, March 22, 2013","This is a really poor company. They don't stand by their word. I won't recommend anybody to buy their service. If you choose them, their words shall be like a leaf on water.  "
The Real PBX,www.therealpbx.com,Chris,"Thursday, February 14, 2013","I was a newbie to business when I opened a small company with 3 of us sitting in a small room. I had heard many of my friends talk about VOIP but didn't know this service is so feasible until I saw The Real PBX pricing. I mean the start-up plan seemed perfect for us. We could just get all the services and honestly, my business has received a lot from their service. Since I am a non-techie, the most important part for me was to get some service where I can have everything configured  and ready-to-use and so they did. Even now when I face any trouble, I can dial their number round the clock and they take the remote session and fix the issue. Great service!  "

Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Wookie Smith,"Friday, June 20, 2014","I've used a couple of other providers for business solutions over the years. Jive has been my best experience so far. I purchased my own equipment for cheap on Amazon, instead of having to rent or pay an arm and a leg. They did the whole set up, and when we went through the set up, it was fully customized to my needs. The experts at Jive were very respectful, knowledgeable, and since I purchased my own equipment. They had to do set it up for their system and didn't give me an attitude for making them do extra work. The ease of set up, great customer support and the great value has made me actually like a service provider."

Jive Communications,www.jive.com,R Scott,"Thursday, June 5, 2014",We've been using Jive for about a year now. The setup is very easy and the system options are awsome. No idea where the one guy who's never had an outage is from but we're having outages with an alarming degree of regularity. To a point I'm shopping for a different provider. 
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Debbie Teed,"Wednesday, June 4, 2014",We  have been with Jive for over a year.  The service has been excellent.  We have not experienced any down time.  The set up was easy and their sales-customer service teams are terrific.  Highly recommend Jive.

Jive Communications,www.jive.com,April Daly,"Thursday, May 29, 2014",We were recently referred to Jive from another Vendor (large internet provider who has been using their service for a number of years) and the transition was smooth considering we also had to port existing numbers.  The Jive folks have EXCEPTIONAL customer service - a rarity in today's  ultra competitive world- and were available to quickly and efficiently answer any questions that came up WITHOUT HAVING TO BE TRANSFERRED TO MULTIPLE INDIVIDUALS!!  YAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I look forward to a long working relationship!  :-)
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Matthew Abrams,"Wednesday, May 28, 2014",We have recently signed up with Jive and are really enjoying the services they are providing for us.

Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Jeff,"Thursday, May 22, 2014","We replaced a traditional analog self hosted PBX with Jive about 2 years ago and it has been great. So much easier to manage, call quality is fantastic, and it is way more flexible. The management portal is power AND easy to use and the techs are great at walking you through setup and configuration. If you buy phones through them they come preconfigured so all you need to do is plug them in. Great service."
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Maryann Roth,"Wednesday, May 21, 2014",Jive has been an absolutely necessary tool in our office.

Jive Communications,www.jive.com,M B,"Tuesday, May 20, 2014","From the beginning Jive was very responsive in all my communications with them.  The customer support is top notch and I've always had my issues resolved within the same day.  They consistently made sure that all our needs were met and I couldn't be happier.  If you're considering Jive, don't hesitate!"
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,James Westbury,"Tuesday, May 20, 2014","We recently completed a migration from an analog PBX to Jive's hosted VoIP PBX, and are very happy with Jive's service. Jive's system replaces most functionality from our old PBX, while adding some useful new features (better ability to filter/block phone calls, for instance) and an easy-to-use, visual dial plan builder, which I've found to be intuitive regardless of who's using it -- it makes equal amounts of sense to me, the system administrator, and to our sales manager.Jive's customer service is also top notch. Jive offers virtual fax machines which can distribute incoming faxes to a specified e-mail address. Unfortunately, I made a mistake in configuring the e-mail address I intended to use for faxes, and managed to block all of our incoming faxes on the first day of use. Jive's technical support department combed their logs and send me information on all faxes sent to our numbers on those days, including caller ID data, so I was able to match their information to our own and confirm that we had not lost any sales due to missed POs. They really went above and beyond with this -- I made a stupid mistake, and they dug into their logs to save me, despite a complete lack of fault on their part.Do be aware that you can probably get a more robust product if you're willing to host your own PBX. But when you host your own PBX, you need someone who can configure and support it, and if it's a VoIP PBX, well... most small businesses simply don't have anyone on-staff who's well-versed enough in VoIP configuration to do so. The support cost of a self-hosted VoIP PBX is worlds higher than Jive's all-inclusive service."
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Rachel Sekerak,"Monday, May 19, 2014","I had a very good customer service experience with Jive's tech department. The tech rep consistently followed-up with me via phone and email to trouble shoot the issues I was having with my phone. I was impressed with their fast response and patience during the process. I work in customer support and  was grateful to experience professionalism and consistent support when I needed it in return. Thanks, JIVE!"
Jive Communications,www.jive.com,Susan Morrison,"Monday, May 19, 2014",Jive is great! The online user portal is easy to set up and you are up and running literally within minutes.

Nextiva,www.nextiva.com,Steve,"Monday, September 29, 2014","With Nextiva I can bank on efficient customer service whenever I call, as I was just reminded again now.

Nextiva,www.nextiva.com,Rick Crowler,"Tuesday, June 10, 2014","Before signing up I was hesitant to switch my phone service to Nextiva. I never heard of this company before and didn't want to risk anything. While I did my research before signing up, I needed more trust. So I first tested the phone service without transfering my numbers over. Customer service was good from the start, my phones were setup easily and the calls were clear. Making it a practical no brainer to switch my phone numbers over to Nextiva. I think it's a good phone service."

Nextiva,www.nextiva.com,Melissa,"Monday, March 31, 2014","I have used Nextiva for my business for about 3 years. While their features, call quality and reliability are all very good, what really sets them apart is the customer support. I have access to the control panel and can make any changes from there, which is nice. I can also use the iPhone app for updates. This is very convenient since I don't always travel with my computer. Even better is that when I need help, I can call Nextiva customer service and they always help me."

Nextiva,www.nextiva.com,Roberto Alameda,"Monday, November 25, 2013","Running my business with Nextiva as the phone service company has been very good. I pay less than what I was paying with Verizon and all around seem to be getting more. Whenever I call the customer service phone number on their website and speak with someone, you can tell that they like their job and are a part of a good company. The things this phone service can do is much much more than what the Verizon service would do and it's easier to deal with a company like Nextiva. Especially when I compare them to Verizon or Vonage. Vonage is the service I use at home and they aren't as good."

They're a safe bet.

Customer support never gave us an answer how to fix the problem, the technician they sent was baffled. I finally had to pay for an outside tech to come diagnose the problem.  He said it was a slowdown with the broadview servers.  Broadview would not admit it was their issue.  We tried to cancel the non-working service and they gave usproblems and continued to bill us.

Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,Barbara,"Thursday, February 26, 2015","Telesphere used to be awesome.  Vonage bought them recently and I didn't know that had taken place, but I did notice immediate voice quality issues that support told me didn't exist, it took weeks instead of days to add or change services, billing credits our payments to the wrong accounts and then has collections call us and make us prove we paid, they add services without getting approval first and then cant correct an invoice in a timely manner, support cannot fix any issues and if they try they change other users settings causing more support calls, one issue they created and then couldn't fix so they just changed the phone number without getting permission first,  I could go on and on.  we are a business and we rely on our phones to do 98% of our business.  30% of the time we have to call someone back on our cell phones so we can have a conversation both parties can hear.  I asked our 3rd party salesperson what could have changed so drastically in the last couple of months and that is when he told me they were under new ownership.  it was like a light switch from great to terrible.   If you don't have Telesphere yet...don't do it!!!  "
Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,CD,"Monday, June 30, 2014","Telesphere is always quick to assist with any issues. I know that every carrier isn't going to be perfect and have the most reliable services, or have 100%  up time. It's all about how the company you have services through handles the issues. I can tell you from personal experience even through I don't have many ""issues"" with Telesphere that always go above and beyond to take care of what ever. For the reason alone, I give them 4 stars and recommend them to anyone looking for hosted services."

Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,Hesam Meshkat,"Thursday, January 9, 2014","Really horrible customer service and support. They said they would scale my plan down to the size appropriate to our smaller facility. Now that I am in, they didn't make the proper adjustments not the bill when moved in, and costing me thousands because they are holding the contract over my head and said they would send it to collections. AVOID USING THEM!"
Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,Stephanie,"Friday, November 22, 2013","Telesphere has been mostly bad since we started service with them about 2 years ago.  Their customer support team does not seem to be able to look at previous notes, how our account is set up, etc. Any time I call in a trouble ticket I have to explain in detail the special way in which our network is designed. It's quite frustrating and only about half of the technicians seem to understand what I am asking. There are many times when lines are routed incorrectly, outbound caller ID's are changed, lines appear to be disconnected....all for no apparent reason.  And they can never give a solid answer as to what caused the issues in the first place.  Secondly, we have a sales rep who is supposed to help with billing issues, special service requests, etc.  It usually takes him a few days to get back to me (unless I'm adding a service), but only after I've hounded him for a response.  Also, when I submit a trouble ticket it typically takes a whole day to get a response. This is unacceptable when it comes to an employee not having a phone or internet connection.  We use the receptionist console software.  This software is not very user-friendly.  It's difficult to learn and difficult to explain to new employees.  It also doesn't seem to be supported very well by Telesphere.  It's never updated and in fact it requires an old version of Java, so if you have another program that requires a new version of Java, you will have a conflict. Our bill is also never correct.  I have to go through it line by line and contact them with corrections (which my sales rep rarely responds to).  They had a great sales pitch and I'll say that their sales team was great for the first few months, but now that we've been a customer for years, it's hard to get in touch with anybody.  I would not recommend Telesphere, but if you do go with them, call in your support requests rather than emailing, call your sales rep rather than emailing, and check your bill carefully each month for inaccurate charges.  "
Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,R Stevens,"Friday, May 3, 2013","Outage after outage. Don't go with this company.  They have zero network. They put blame on other providers saying it wasn't their fault. If there is an outage, they try and blame me first then send out some crummy email stating what the problem is and no real solution to it. I have a solution, get your own network then you can blame yourself when stuff doesn't work. Don't waste your time with this joke of a company. No local support and no idea how to problem solve. "
Telesphere,www.telesphere.com,Justin,"Thursday, January 24, 2013",We were one of the first customers of a group called Unity that has since been purchased/merged with Telesphere.  The service phone since the merger has been bad and the customer service worse.  We have never seen a Telesphere rep and the solution to most problems seems to be for us to reboot our phones.

From hardware failing (both drives of a mirror RAID array failed, resulting in total loss), from failed promises to sales rep placing orders without approval, to billing snafu's. To top it all off, every response is to blame the customer and placing the burden of proof on the customer, even after sending their own emails back to them as proof of their unkept promises.

MegaPath,www.megapath.com,Scott Rubel,"Friday, March 1, 2013","I was so proud of myself a few years ago when I switched from AT&T; to Megapath and brought my invoices down from $700 to $450 per month. Their installation seemed to go well at first, but a couple of months after installation our outgoing internet stopped working. I discovered the reason was that, even though they had installed all their equipment, I had still been hooked up to AT&T; for sending. I know this doesn't seem to make sense, but it was when AT&T; finally got wise and shut us off that our sending stopped working. That was our first experience with getting Megapath to admit something was their problem. Phone and internet companies control many of the strings to business success. So, how do they expect their customers to do well when all the onus of chasing down a problem is put on the customer. The customer cannot pay attention to the business and instead has to sit on hold or running test after test (all the same tests over and over again) just so that Megapath can avoid responsibility. It logically follows that either their customer will have to end the service or go out of business because we can't receive emails and phone calls. I do not know how it profits Megapath to treat customers this way, in the long run. Things with the T1 line were fairly good for a couple of years (after they finally fixed the initial AT&T; service mix-up), except the service was slower than advertised. Then the bill went up $200 a month. This was due to new taxes, so maybe I can't blame them for this, but still it seems like they should have done something to compensate or compromise to insulate the shock. Sticking on a new tax we weren't warned about and expecting us to just keep paying seems stupid. In the last month our service failed completely. No phone and no internet. We would call and every time they would try to make us run the same internal test. They obfuscated and delayed sending someone out with a new device, or to even move the problem up the ladder. In an entire month, we were on the phone (mobile phone) almost every day for over an hour. Finally they told us they had people in the field working side by side with AT&T; (those guys again?) and, when they finally told us everything was working, it wasn't."

Okta,www.okta.com,Jessica,"Wednesday, July 16, 2014","Okta is a life saver! It has helped alleviate the stress many of our staff has about remembering the passwords to the numerous utilities that they use. It's easy to use, easy to configure, and a great investment!"
Okta,www.okta.com,Bob,"Tuesday, July 15, 2014","Okta is a strong SSO app, that allows you to manage identities as well.  If you are looking to satisfy identity architecture requirements while also getting rid of passwords, there is no better app."
Okta,www.okta.com,Devin Garrett,"Friday, June 27, 2014","Okta isn't just Single Sign On, it's an identity solution.  They have lots of features that provide added value including active directory integration, multi-factor authentication, and a huge library of pre-verified (integrated), applications.  Their support doesn't just stop at a phone call either. They give you the knowledge and tools to conquer the cloud."
Okta,www.okta.com,Russell O'Hern,"Tuesday, April 22, 2014","As a consultant, I have integrated Okta in a number of organizations over the past couple of years.  We have connected tens of thousands of users to hundreds of applications including the big ones like Salesforce, Zendesk, Jive, IBM Global Expense Reporting. Okta has streamlined the integration process through the use of their Application Network.; a catalog of thousands of templates already configured to work with common business and personal applications. SSO has been reduced to quick and simple process.The ease of which you can import users, configure SSO for apps, and manage permissions is phenomenal. Connecting Okta to Active Directory takes all of 15 minutes!  This also allows you to let users change their AD passwords without requiring helpdesk assistance. Great Stuff!"
Okta,www.okta.com,Or Cingilli,"Tuesday, April 8, 2014","We first considered Okta as a solution to Office 365 authentication.

If we had any issues at all, support was quick to respond and resolve.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"

CloudEntr,www.cloudentr.com,Duane Nathaniel,"Tuesday, December 16, 2014",My company needed a solution that would allow us to share confidential files while still maintaining a secure method to maintain those shared files. CloudEntr fit the bill perfectly. It allowed wide-reaching access via the web and provided a high level of encryption.

As usual you never find the correct credentials when you are in a hurry, so a friend of mine, who it is also a developer, recommended me to give a change to CloudEntr, he promised it will simplify my development work by allowing me to switch between orgs by just clicking a link and... it did it!, CloudEntr definitely did the work and more.After a few days of trying the trial period I asked my boss to pay for it and let other people in the company use it and forget about remembering usernames and paswords.We have been using it for 4 months and we love it. We use it not only for business, we use it to help us manage every kind of login."

The service is reliable, and has plenty of useful extra features like login automation, and ""secure notes"" which allow you to securely store other information."
CloudEntr,www.cloudentr.com,Kim E,"Friday, December 5, 2014","CloudEntr has become a daily tool that I depend on to login to  my many Cloud application logins. It's simple, inexpensive, and dependable and it's easy to share the logins with coworkers securely, too. "
CloudEntr,www.cloudentr.com,Sam Kimelman,"Tuesday, April 8, 2014","It's embarrassing to admit that we used to keep all our passwords in separate spreadsheets. Not only was it a huge pain, it was not particularly secure. Whenever an employee left, we'd have to manually change every password. Which is a huge waste of time and CloudEntr is cheap so I'm sure we're saving money. Now only a few people ever see the passwords in the first place.Also, it's actually easier than copying and pasting passwords from a spreadsheet."

Crushpath,www.crushpath.com,Nick Furlano,"Thursday, April 9, 2015","I would definitely not recommend the service. Not only was the sales pitch so well presented and closed, but the service was beyond sub par, and client care was just terrible. When I opted to cancel, they had me believe it was beneficial to keep the campaign running until the next renewal period and work on optimizing the campaign with me - which they neglected to do anything and I ended up having to call visa to reverse charges as they just billed me again anyway. To sum it up, I spent nearly $2000 for absolutely nothing, 1 soft lead was generated, and they offered no money back, and didn't run my campaign at full strength either so exposure was also lacking. I would steer clear of their service completely, I found it to be a complete rip off, and feel as if I was swindled."
Crushpath,www.crushpath.com,Kim L,"Wednesday, September 24, 2014","Wow--very disappointing.  One more bad experience with an 'e' start up whose sales guys over promise but the back room under delivers.

It took some time for us to get the interface live because the various ways that we handle our customers needs is a valuable differentiation from our competitors  but makes connecting 2 systems quite challenging. The InterWeave engineers, led by Dmytro, were clever problem solvers and achieved a connection between QB Online and Salesforce for billing that has saved us the expense of 1 full time team member manually creating the bills! There are some limitations to what the online version of QB offers, but Dmytro and his team helped to come up with solutions around the limitations. If you choose to go with these guys, let them help you take away grunt work of entering things into 2 systems. Unless your business is really straightforward, it may take some time to work through all of the nuances, but you cant argue with saving the labor cost of an entire team member  and thats only our first phase of billing! We have future phases that we will continue with InterWeave, and we will only continue to become more and more efficient."
"Integration Technologies, Inc.",www.interweave.biz/,Jane Gyorgy,"Thursday, February 18, 2016","I have been working with computers since 1985. As a small business owner for the past 25 years it was only in 1998 I started to work with QuickBooks. With a few hitches in between, I took my company to the cloud with Sales Force in 2006, and integrated SF with QB through InterWeave in 2007 and have never looked back. Between 1998 and 2006 I had the misfortune of working with several companies that did not understand what I wanted, what I needed and couldn't deliver even on what they did profess to do, and their technical support was sorely lacking. Interweave has made it possible for smooth integration of my CRM / Scheduling program (Sales Force) and my Financial Management program (QuickBooks). They listened to what I was attempting to accomplish, customized their program to fit my needs, and have provided the best customer service since day one that I have encountered in my 31 years of experience with technical support of any kind.  Recently, Sales Force changed the encryption platform which required my files to be moved to a dedicated server. About the same time, it became obvious my original QuickBooks company file, in use since 1998, could no longer handle incoming from SalesForce. When we needed to create a new file and sync SalesForce to it, InterWeave made that transition as smooth as silk, as if it only required flipping a switch. It took much more than that on their end, but on mine, they couldn't have made it seem any easier. I cannot say enough good about InterWeave so I will leave you with this: My name is Jane Gyorgy. I am the owner of DeepVac Inc. and you can reach me at 415-850-4722. I stand behind my word and recommend InterWeave without reservation. "
Kosmos Central,www.kosmoscentral.com,Jeff Happe,"Monday, June 6, 2016","I would give 5 stars, but eSync does need a couple more features which they are working on.   I like that they do listen and will put feature requests customers absolutely need in the front of others.   This software helped us with our brick and mortar multi store locations with Magento and Revel Systems cloud POS.  We can now send all of our inventory to each unique Magento Web Store which is awesome.  Some logistics for setup of our five locations, but once done this is an amazing integration.  Magento is a resource HOG, so make sure you optimize your server so it will accept all the data that's being updated constantly from Revel, otherwise your server will go down.  We updated our Max SQL connections from 50 to 300, along with a few other optimized settings and everything works great!    Great software, absolutely needed by any brick and mortar store that needs an eCommerce and Amazon, eBay integration."
Kosmos Central,www.kosmoscentral.com,Nicholas Alexander,"Thursday, February 19, 2015","I've worked with other platforms and there's so many different software solutions today in the cloud.  Kosmos eSync is not saving any of my customers data and eSync processes data in real time. We've worked with other companies, like NChannel, eBride, Mule Soft (list goes on and on) and they all save your data in their SaaS software.  A feature thats sold to customers is having the ability to manage your data in their software once migrated over.   This is highly problematic when you're copying data to another resource and making changes to it.  My customers data is already being managed in its Master location or ERP/POS.   We've ran into all kinds of data integrity problems with these other solutions.  Why not just send it as intended to its destination?   Kosmos eSync is a complete breath of FRESH AIR!   No Data Integrity problems at all!  Everything migrates to the connections we intended it to go and unchanged!    Thank you again Kosmos eSync, for designing a system that works amazingly!  I can now bill out my customer for support they actually need and avoid the constant beratings of the past from the other solutions I got them involved with.

Lettuce Apps,www.lettuceapps.com,Robert,"Monday, October 6, 2014","It has a very nice interface with a good customer service but stopped iPad support and has a few critical technical glitches which caused me to shop for a new application. It is a pity that I had to dump this application after spending more than 70 days of setting up my wholesale distribution company on Lettuceapps thinking that I finally found a good application. It is a very good application as long as it works. If your operation is simple, you can use it without too many problem. I had to look for a better solution. I am test driving Handshake order management. It seems working better than Lettuceapps and I haven't found any major glitches I experienced with Lettuceapps."

We no longer have to spend time copying and pasting order information or shipping information into multiple different programs. Lettuce allows us to easily keep track of our inventory and orders and everything syncs with Quickbooks! We have a fulfillment center and Lettuce allows us to wirelessly print all our invoices, packing slips and shipping labels from anywhere in the world with the click of one button. Lettuce has quickly become my most used software day in and day out. Me and the PrideBites team highly recommend this app for your business!"
Lettuce Apps,www.lettuceapps.com,Todd Moffett,"Thursday, April 4, 2013",Ultimately it started out that we were looking for a good/easy way to sync all of our shopify orders into QuickBooks. Everything that I looked into was cumbersome and or ugly. Lettuce has done a great job at building UI that does so much. We're now a full on Lettuce team. Sales uses lettuce with custom user permissions to enter orders and customers. Shipping uses it to print out the packing slips and labels and send customer tracking emails. And our accounting team never has to do anything but QB now. The iPad app is great for trade shows and special sales events. A mini version app. You can create custom price variants as well as lead source labels for any type of event. In my own opinion the iPad app is reason enough to have Lettuce. The support has been great too. Assistance was available right away to help with all the right answers. Lettuce has definitely made our whole teams life much easier.
Lettuce Apps,www.lettuceapps.com,Michael Fishman,"Thursday, April 4, 2013",Lettuce has changed our business. No longer will you spend time on data entry. Lettuce will push all your retail sales directly from your webstore on Shopify to QuickBooks. No longer will you spend time printing shipping labels or packing lists - Lettuce will automatically generate UPS/FedEx/Stamps.com labels and packing lists with the press of one button. We get over 50 orders / day and Lettuce allows us to process and ship out these orders in 2 minutes with the press of one button. Lettuce will also automatically update your inventory on Shopify so you won't have to deal with manually editing your inventory if you also sell your products wholesale. I am not sure how we would run our business without it.

Pricing is extremely competitive. "

Here is how you could approach that."". In most instances, you can take the core software and make it your own with relative ease. The support has been fantastic in responsiveness and answering questions about how to make the application fit our business. Before we used supaTools, we were floundering with what assets we had and what tickets were our priority. With the SLA integration, we are now providing a better service to our internal customers and have really good data to make good business decisions. Pros: The environment is web-based and has a lot of different automation and integration points including active directory for logins. We utilize email ingestion through our Office365 account and it works like a champ for creating tickets and responding to tickets via email. The core allows you to add, remove, change features and fields with ease. Templates are key for incidents, which you can create many of to allow customers to fill in minimal aspects of an issue while still giving you pre-populated fields for reporting and SLA needs.Cons: With any highly customizeable system, you run the risk of making things too complicated.If you have your internal processes defined well, it makes the transition to this product very easy."

They take forever to reply to inquiries and, when they do, they act as though they would prefer to not be bothered. Lack of customization and poor customer service makes this a bad fit for me."

CloudHostSpace,www.cloudhostspace.com,Nordic Nate,"Tuesday, September 24, 2013","They send unsolicited spam to email addresses they bought on the black market. Their emails violate CAN SPAM. Their website has no physical address either. They hide. That can't be good. I wouldn't trust them with my credit card info. If you're smart, you don't depend on them for your business, because they aren't legit."

I have never waited longer than 15 minutes for a response. Highly recommended ! 10 out of 10 from me."
LinuxCloudVPS,www.linuxcloudvps.com,Kyrosh,"Monday, June 25, 2012","I have experience with Windows environment but none with Linux and I have about a dozen projects that I needed to start in Linux environment (because of a specific base-software that I needed to use). Therefore, the key (i.e. make or break) to being able to start and move forward with these projects or not has been to find the support that would help me basically with everything. Being able to find that kind of support was something that I was very unsure of based on my almost 20 years experience of working with companies and support teams. Yet this time within 4 days my server is set up and all my sites are up and running. This is despite many challenges that your support team experienced mainly because of working with someone who doesn't know Linux.  I am still in disbelief about what happened! What set the work of your support team apart from others has been several. The foremost important factor has been their responsiveness that has constantly been literally either immediate or within minutes, around the clock, and throughout probably 50 or more emails that I sent to them during the process. This was simply unheard of to me. Another factor has been that your support team started the tasks (such as setting up the server and installing several software that I had provided) within minutes of my request emails, and notified me that the process was complete very shortly after that. When I needed to send them information or files/software, or needed to perform any tasks they sent me very specific instructions and advices that I could follow easily even though I am new to Linux environment. They were also persistent when something wouldn't work as expected (mainly due to my lack of knowledge of the environment) and continued steady work until the problem was resolved as quickly as possible. They were always professional, cooperative, and assisted when I made any mistakes.  I have probably left out some other aspects of the truly amazing and unique services and help that I received from your support team. I will surely tell others about the outstanding support team/department of your company."

The servers are very affordable, especially when compared to what you get in terms of RAM/static IPV4/SUPPORT! and I could go on and on. The customer service is one of a kind, EXTREMELY quick response to your questions and if you ask to have something fixed or done - well, at least I have never had to wait more than 45 minutes. So to summarize: stable, fast and unique!"

Lost all my emails from yesterday. Clients are annoyed. This company has cost me $$$ but more importantly they have damaged my reputation with my clients.
Supreme Servers,www.supremeservers.com,Yann Yannek,"Thursday, July 18, 2013","In February when I started to order a VPS with them I had many issues, now after 5 months my website is down for more than 13 hours. As a result I lost many sales. They are not able to fix the problem and have to migrate my account to another data center. Stay away of supreme servers. I would call this company supreme problems. I was paying 3$/month before and chose to upgrade with Supreme Servers for 33$/month the service is the worst I ever received. They claim 100% uptime, I will say 100% downtime."
AccuPages,www.accupages.com,Sally,"Monday, September 19, 2016",I have a small website and I use their service for 3 years now. I saved a lot of money and my site loads faster too. The reason I am writing this review is that I feel I need to give them credit for the price and service they provide. I used to pay more than double with previous host and my site was slower.
Advantagecom Networks,www.simplywebhosting.com,Daryll,"Monday, July 6, 2015","I was with Advantagecom Networks for about 2-1/2 years and in that time we experienced lots of periods of random downtime. From what seemed like network maintenance to even my VM being rebooted because of ""issues"". 2-1/2 years into service I received a notice that my VM had load spikes and they demanded root access to the VM within 24 hours or would shut down my VM. Any administrator knows that this is normal and that servers spike and go idle during different traffic periods. So basically it was just a B.S. excuse to gain access to my server. I of course did not concede to their demands and moved my services to another host. If I had been out of town, I would have come back to my server being offline and all my websites down. When I asked for a refund because of the change of terms of service I was basically told to go #hell. This is a small company and they act like it. So save your time and money and go to a real hosting provider that will not violate your privacy rights. Amazon, Linode, DigitalOcean are just a few good ones, depending on your needs."

YourDomainGoesHere,yourdomaingoeshere.com/,Matthias Zeitler,"Saturday, April 7, 2012",We had several VPS with them. Out of the blue they suspended the main VPS suddenly for load related issues. After several days they told us that they cannot unsuspend the VPS since they have deleted the data to make room for other customers. Of course they still took our money and didn't agree to a refund. Since this was a production system the incident caused us a lot of trouble. I would not recommend them for any serious hosting.

Wax Space,www.waxspace.com,Christopher Gregory,"Thursday, July 21, 2016","There service is rapidly going down the toilet.  Since I started with them the STAFF have used the root over-ride password to loginto my account and delete three email accounts without my permission and trying to blame me for it. I have had to contact technical support three times since may this year with disk space running out on / and due to this not being able to log into my account for a couple of hours or more. They are also preventing customers from sending email complaints about spammers to the abuse departments of the spammers.  Do not respond saying that they don't as they have implimented an outgoing mail filter that scans the contents of your mail. They are protecting the spammers that are employed by commercial/business customers. They also do not like SEPERATE instances of support tickets being opened due to the fact that they are blocking a SINGLE LEGITIMATE complaint to an isp/hosting provider.  They merged my tickets and did absolutely nothing about it. I have the support tickets and dates of the failed disk space, and am happy to post them if needs be. I would give them a current rating of 0 bordering on -1.   Christopher"

But I don't found any of them giving such plans with extra features with Unlimited disk space,bandwidth that too plans starting from $0.90 only."

Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Brad Samuels,"Wednesday, December 17, 2014","We did not have good success with HostPapa.  Theyhad issues with their server (that hosted our website) going down.  Doesn't matter if you call, email, online chat, or start a ticket.  Usually wait 5 to 24 hours for support.  Moved our website hosting to another company, after being with them for 3 months, due to lack of support and customer service."

I had some problem with the email setup, but issues were quickly resolved bu HostPapa Support staff and have recently used the Knowledgebase system to set up Android Device.

Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Michael Moriarty,"Tuesday, December 2, 2014",I switched to Hostpapa almost four years ago and I am glad I did. The price is good and the service as well.

Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Adam,"Wednesday, November 19, 2014",I just recently switched my web hosting company to Hostpapa and have been very happy with my decision.

Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Sandy Cee,"Thursday, November 13, 2014","After being with another few web hosting companies and been hacked into, I wasn't sure about this Host Papa. However, their name came from a good referral I found online and so I decided to bring all my websites over to them. I am not only contented, yet a happy customer too. I invested in the three year web hosting as the product was so competitively priced. They were there every step of the way to help me get everything set up and help me to move my websites from one hosting company of their own. I have four domains already, plus looking at bringing my clients over as well as I grow my Web Development business.They are really great for service with a smile - polite AND helpful. My domains have never been offline or down in the three years I have been with them. I would highly recommend them to anyone who asks for a referral to a great reputable hosting company."

It's easy to use, customer support is responsive and helpful - that is very important to me. Because time is money in the business. Great price range, and I like the ""one shop stop"" package like deals they offer (hosting / domain / email / support) all at once. "
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Jill,"Wednesday, September 17, 2014",We have been with Host Papa for over 5 years and are very pleased with them.

The unlimited account is great and there has not been any time when the service has been down."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,David Cohen,"Friday, September 12, 2014","We've been with HostPapa for web hosting for years now. Their pricing is terrific, their customer service is great, they offer tons of software -- far more than we use -- and their special offers are a great deal. I think there may have been one occasion when my site was down due to HostPapa issues, but I'm not sure. Essentialy, outtages aren't an issue. I'm happy!"
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Paul,"Thursday, September 4, 2014",We have just  made our first site with the HostPapa software...  Very Easy...  in the near futur we  should upgrade to other features available with HostPapa  
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Marian Hyland,"Friday, August 29, 2014","Host Papa has changed the way we run our business, it has given us the freedom to make our own changes and take complete control of our website. Before we had to ring or email our webmaster to make changes, as he was very incompetent and slow at making changes, it could be up to a week before the changes are made. In our BnB business, if we decide to change our rates or promote a special, we need to make our customers aware immediately, not days after. With Host Papa, it was easy to use, easy to upload, and within seconds our site was ready. There is also plenty of tools to utilize from the CPanel and great instructions. Thanks to Host Papa we now have a convenient way of updating our website. I would recommend them highly."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Steven Wright,"Friday, August 29, 2014",We have been with HostPapa for a number of years now and have been extremely satisfied. The web hosting is easy to use competitively priced and very reliable.
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Bernard M.,"Friday, August 22, 2014","I run a not-for-profit site dedicated to offering meditative content. Therefore, I wanted a trouble-free hosting company that offered the most for the least. And I found Host Papa. This is the best web hosting company by far. They take care of my domain registration, they offer a lot of important features at a very low price, and yet you get almost 100% availability, unlimited bandwidth, huge storage space, and full integration with Dreamweaver, which is very convenient for me. I design my own content and interface, and it is instantly synchronized with Host Papa without a glitch. I have never had any problems whatsoever. Also, I use their secure services which happened to be very effective last year, as they detected an infected site that one of my outgoing links was pointing to. Safety for me and safety for my visitors. True peace of mind! And their control panel provides all the statistics you could ever dream of. I am in my 3rd year with Host Papa, and I am very very happy with them! I highly recommend Host Papa. It really is the best bang for the buck."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Tim H,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","We have been using HostPapa to host small scale business websites, and we have had great results so far in New Zealand. No known downtime, their DNS system is great, emails never get lost etc. Occasional spam issues, but these are normally due to incorrectly configured cPanels."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Malissa Baldwin,"Wednesday, August 20, 2014","When it came time to build my website I was seeking a company where I wouldn't have to worry about downtime & the site would be fast and responsive.  Host Papa has provided that and a simple CPanel interface that easily allowed me to explore many other possibilities.  The customer support is fast and friendly.  I recommend Host Papa for your hosting needs, it will be the only one you will ever need. "
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Rene V,"Tuesday, August 19, 2014","I have been hosting sites with HostPapa for over 3 years now and I am very satisfied with the service. Every time we had an issue, HostPapa was able to solve it quickly. The Online Chat feature has proven to be very efficient in solving most of our issues. They even have multilingual staff that were able to help us in our language. Futhermore, the price for the hosting services is very reasonnable. No hidden fees whatsoever. I would never move anywhere else. HostPapa is number 1 for me."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Alex B,"Monday, August 18, 2014",Host Papa is by far the best hosting company ever. I live in Audtralia and have never had an issue with performance at all. cPanel is easy to use and makes creating your website fun!

Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Andrew Ulrich,"Wednesday, August 13, 2014","Over the 5 years I have been with Hostpapa, I have not had any major complaints with their service, their uptime, or their hosting.  The hosting speed has always been satisfactory on their end even though it's shared hosting.  There have been a few downtimes, but they have been rare, and have not exceeded their guarantee.  I have not had to wait too long for any requests or inquiries.  The control panel is adequate, and they have been good about keeping up with php/mysql versions.  I do not plan on switching hosts in the forseeable future, and have recommended their service to friends and clients due to their price and green efforts."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,YorkWebDev.com,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","  Host Papa has gotten quite large over the last 10 years, however, it has maintained a small company environment, meaning it still feels like you are talking to a friend that can seek a speedy resolution to any problem. This should remain!  Plus I will tell you this, I have been suffering for a VERY long term(20yrs) and as it's ""NEW"" to the medical profession, some doctors say it's in men's heads. I've ridden dirt bikes since I was in grade school. I've cracked/bruised ribs and put my head off to one side by about 2 inches in a small and simple accident. It took about a year to get my head straight and my muscles all more or less back in order. One trap muscle is still higher than the other.  Sorry the POINT, I know pain...morphine levels of PAIN! The CP-CPPS (chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome) has left me homeless and in a ditch...yes legal action is under way as I am an M/F  IT-Consultant, but was working for a large multinational, who would not give me long term disability and their hired doc (who never even saw me), told them it was psychological! I was the poster child of the last research study, where some are as young as 15 (pre-sexual activity), mine started slightly later! WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS !!? Once Host Papa heard this they renewed my account at a GREATLY discounted rate so that I could at least further my Net_Dev education. I WAS FLOORED AND STUNNED as $20/day does not go far. THUS, I move ahead with a tear rolling down my cheek, this time not from pain but from human compassion. This is NOT the exception but the rule...try that with Rogers or Bell!Joe Riverdale (alias)  YorkWebDev.com (Blank for NOW :) !)   "
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Tecalli,"Monday, August 11, 2014",Host Papa hosting provides a very good service and options. Quality-Price is excellent and customer service responds fast. 
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Laurie,"Monday, August 11, 2014","I switched to HostPapa on the recommendation of a friend and I've been extremely satisfied with their hosting service. My previous host was solid but their interface was too complicated for my intermediate level skills. This is not the case with HostPapa! Their interface is extremely user friendly, their knowledge database is excellent, and if you open a ticket it is dealt with quickly and efficiently. I also appreciate the fact that my hosting plan is so inexpensive and so robust! And they run on 100% green energy  - what's not to love about that? I highly recommend HostPapa."
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,Andrew,"Monday, August 11, 2014",What attracted me to HostPapa was that its a 'green' company and was competitively priced. It was easy to set up and when I've had technical questions they were answered promptly and professionally. I've not had any downtime so far (approx 11 months) so in terms of availability and reliability all good. All in all a positive experience. Only reason for 4 stars (not 5) is I've only used a couple of providers. This one is by far the best so far.
Host Papa,www.hostpapa.com,William,"Monday, August 11, 2014",I have dealt with HostPapa for close to three years now. I started off using their service at work to run our website.

Hyperstreet.com,www.hyperstreet.com,Alan,"Tuesday, January 21, 2014","BRUTAL customer service. I am quite sure they don't even know what that term means. I was treated very rudely by a supposed tech who has ZERO customer service skills. When I complained about them using their complaint email - the same person I complained about was the one who responded. They then said that by complaining about them, I was harassing them!!! One email to state I wasn't happy. One email to explain for a second time why. And one email to complain about the tech. Does this constitute harassment!? What a joke! On top of this, the tech then states they are a co-owner of the company and my account is suspended. I have all the emails as my proof. Can you believe a company that needs customers to make money thinks the best way to do that is to treat customers like crap and then throw them away?!!! Ridiculous. This company shouldn't even be in business but they wont be for long with brutal attitudes like this. Good riddance to a crap company. I highly recommend NO ONE deal with this company, EVER."

RoseHosting,www.rosehosting.com,Kerry Caldwell,"Monday, December 8, 2014",Me and my brother are developers from UK and we do not have enough knowledge in managing a Linux VPS. That was the only reason why we were looking for a reliable fully-managed VPS service. We found RoseHosting after few months and after few unsuccessful sign ups with other hosts. I must confess I am really surprised about their knowledge and their relationship with their customers in comparison with the other hosts. They are amazing and few levels above their competition. I recommend them very highly.

They offered me a 7 day money back guarantee and free website migration. I am still with Rosehostng after seven months so I can rate them very highly because I haven't experienced any downtime yet, they have very helpful support team and they have very cheap hosting plans. I can honestly recommend them. "

There are many things about RoseHosting that I really appreciate, including excellent server security and stability, no overselling of bandwidth or disk usage, 99.9 % server uptime etc... but the key factor that always amazes me is the customer/technical support they offer. They have helped me on numerous occasions even when I was the blame for the problems in the first place. Very knowledgeable, polite and patient (which in my case there was a great need of patience from their side since I am a noob for Linux administration), they are even going out of their support scope in order to help me. Also, RoseHosting tech support guys are always available, even on weekends and holidays.Performance wise, I noticed that my websites are a lot faster after I started to host with them. My load time used to be around 4.5 seconds, and subsequently it dropped to 900ms (tested using pingdom tools).

My site has been down for most of the last week and tech support, which normally was good, has been unresponsive and unhelpful. Which is a problem when you're on a dedicated server and have no root access so you can't even hire an outside professional to fix it. Moreover, tech requests take so long right now, that who knows when my request to gain root access will go through. In short, I am done with this company. "

InMotion Hosting,www.inmotionhosting.com,Tim,"Thursday, September 6, 2012","I wasted probably about 8 hours the last few days trying to install wordpress onto my companies website into a sub directory. The trouble was that after installing it, it displayed a directory of files rather than the webpage/blog. I'm a pretty tech savvy guy and usually I have no issues with this kind of thing. I'm also very good at using Google to help me solve issues like this. I couldn't find anything on Google that helped me, nor I could find any help within the wordpress help documents or forums. After spending about 15 minutes with InMotion support chat, Nick W easily helped me solve the problem!! The only reason it took 15 minutes is because he patiently waited while I reuploaded and installed wordpress in order to walk me through the heart of the issue. Our company has 4 other websites besides the one we have hosted with InMotion, and they are all hosted with different hosting companies. We have been wanting to bring them all to one hosting company and because of the OUTSTANDING service that Nick W has provided, I'm going to recommend to our CEO that we move our other sites over to InMotion in the coming weeks. Thanks Nick W, and thank you InMotion!!!"

We diligently reviewed their network design and support processes and determined that their Cloud meets or exceeds every aspect of HIPAAs stringent security requirements.With announcements of data breaches occurring with frightening regularity, we wanted a network and partner that had the technology and experience to ensure at the highest degree that ExamMeds client data was completely protected from unauthorized access.Highly recommend Enki to those seeking a cloud solution.

NaviSite,www.navisite.com,Richinsd,"Friday, April 6, 2012","If I had a choice of 0 stars I would have chosen it. My site was hosted on Navisite (Andover Mass) for the past two years. I am beyond glad to be off their servers. As a final straw, My BIG issue with this company is their deplorable business practices. (((WARNING))) BE VERY CAREFUL IF YOU SIGN A CONTRACT WITH NAVISITE!!! There is a clause in their rediculously long contract that states in effect: IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL YOUR SERVICE 30 DAYS BEFORE THE CURRENT CONTRACT EXPIRATION, IT AUTOMATICALLY RENEWS FOR ANOTHER FULL TERM!!!!!!! THERE IS NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION OF TERM ENDING! They hosted my site for more than two years. Even though my initial contract was up with them without incident and I have formally cancelled service with 30 days notice, they now threaten to come after me to satisfy the remainder of their automatically renewed contract. In my opinion, the idea that any company let alone one the size of Navisite/Time Warner, uses these types of bullying tactics as a customer retention strategy is repugnant. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT RECOMMEND DOING BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY! There are far too many reputable choices out there today to have to make that choice."

UnitedLayer,www.unitedlayer.com,Garry ,"Friday, April 24, 2015",Hybrid cloud is the biggest Joke of service UnitedLayer offers. No up time and worst service by far.
UnitedLayer,www.unitedlayer.com,Kevin,"Thursday, December 11, 2014","Unitedlayer has multiple floors in 200 Paul Ave where depending on where you colocate, you will have at least a few black outs a month. The city of San Francisco moved in almost 5 yeas ago to colocate our equipment within Unitedlayer. Since the new management took over, we have had all sort of issues with our uptime, service and even billing. Abhijit Phanse and his team are very un aware of how to run Unitedlayer since it was taken over.We are just waiting for our contract to expire so we can run out of there."

Pay Per Cloud,www.PayPerCloud.com,Anne Lind,"Thursday, October 30, 2014","I think Pay Per Cloud is one of those companies that comes around once in a while. I have been them for about 6 months now and I have to say that I have been thouroughly impressed with everything from their sales approach to their tech support!!! I had a million technical questions during the sales process and then onboarding process and their team is incredibly competent and service-oriented. The systems provided are all top-of-the-line; I don't get the feeling they cut corners.  Without hesitation, based on my experience, I give Pay Per Cloud 5 Stars!!!!!"

Pay Per Cloud,www.PayPerCloud.com,Adam Plocher,"Monday, May 19, 2014","They have decent uptime, but their support is very slow.  Even for a critical but simple task.  Not only that, they shut our site down due to malware but never notified ANYONE.  We just happened to go to our site and it was suspended.  After calling we figured it out.  I have done some external malware scans and found some items, but they obviously must have a report of some kind and I've now waited over two hours for it.  This is not our first time having problems with their support.  Definitely would NOT recommend this company.  They host at Raging Wire.  IF you really want to host in Sacramento, I recommend going straight to the source or find another provider that uses that datacenter."

I learned that none of those matter if you aren't quoting what you really need. I learned that after a sales session with Pay Per Cloud, which turned out to be a lengthy consult spanning 2 weeks [and they didn't charge me for that! :) ] I got a great education in the process. Very professional group. Anyway, 4 months later after going live and largely the only issues were things I probably neglected to provide early on. It's been a genuinely good experience and I'm very comfortable with the decisions I've made."

The thought of migrating to Hosted Exchange concerned me because we don't have an IT person on staff and I (the owner) have to take on that role. I have to say that the migration process was far easier than I ever expected. I was able to do the conversion myself, even though PPC offered to do it for free, but I wanted to do it at an odd time that conflicted with a previously scheduled migration on their end. Their support staff was excellent throughout the migration and I had all 19 of our accounts set up within a 6-7 hours. I would highly recommend using PPC for their Hosted Exchange service."
Pay Per Cloud,www.PayPerCloud.com,Latisha,"Wednesday, August 8, 2012","I've been a client for a long time. I must say that I have been quite pleased with the service from Pay Per Cloud. When I first needed to make changes to distribution groups and add aliases, I had no trouble getting support, and they were patient and offered to do it for me if I liked. I do most of my work online in the night and even at 1:00am I am able to get someone right away when I call them. The people I talk to are very professional and competent. I am not sure about the other poster here as I didn't have those issues; perhaps they were limited or localized to him?

123together,www.123together.com,Michael Warren,"Tuesday, June 4, 2013","After major down time with a small client using Exchange on their 2003 sbs, I did some research and contracted with 123together. We were able to get up and running again within the day. Their support is amazing when a rare problem comes up. The setup was very easy using their applet to change Outlook accounts. They also included an update of Outlook for each user. This was a great feature in getting all PCs on the same page. During the last few years, I can't remember any downtime at all. The control panel for adding or changing users is web based and very easy to navigate. I'd recommend them to any small business (those are my clients) to use instead of them running it themselves."
Intermedia,www.intermedia.net,Ariel Brooke,"Thursday, January 24, 2013","I don't know where to begin. Intermedia is moving to the top of the world. Intermedia owns their hosting service, they don't lease or pay a sub-lease like others do. This gives Intermedia the edge on pricing, that's why they don't charge any  fees, and no subscription charges, you only pay month to month. I'm glad I switched. On day 1, I had a problem. I called them at 2am, these folks were there, ready to help and it turns out it was a error that I made. Even with that thought in mind, they didn't hang up, they stayed with me until things were running smoothly and there was no charge. Intermedia is really ready to help you get set up and running, you are not left in the dark. "
"Hostway Services, Inc.",www.hostway.com/,John Wayne,"Monday, March 24, 2014","I am appalled by their customer service and incompetence. I paid Hostway to transfer two .PRO domains to their company and they listed the action as ""pending"" for a month. Multiple attempts at entering my transfer code and contacting customer service failed. The problem was that they were affiliated with the company I was transferring my domains from. Finally when the domains went dead I stayed on the phone with their tech support and billing for over 30 minutes just to find out that they could NOT transfer my domain due to their affiliation with DomainPeople. Of course there was no way I could know this. Then when I contacted DomainPeople and explained the issue they told me they would ""fix"" it for $125. Thanks so very much Hostway for costing me my domains and stealing my money without delivering a service. I would not recommend DomainPeople or Hostway for anyone at all. They are money grubbing incompetent and unprofessional."

When I circled back to Hostway they told me I was already signed up to their website service and that even a newbie could have it up and going in a couple of hours.

Their customer support team is by far the best I have ever worked with. When there are no issues most hosting companies will do, but when a problem arises, that is where the professional companies like Hostway stand above the rest. The few issues that I had were quickly resolved by Hostways customer service techs that walked me though every step of the way. When you have a problem with your website, every minute it is down counts and cheaper companies cant be low enough for the lost revenue of just one day of down time. Hostways team responded quickly and helped me even though I was the one that created the issues. Additionally, Hostway provides many extras that other less expensive services charge extra for, making the so called discount companies more expensive in the end. After trying different services over the years, I can highly recommend Hostway for their solid performance as a hosting company and for the professional services they provide."

On the rare occasion that a support staff can not answer our question, we are quickly put in touch with someone who can.  Thanks to them we have been able to grow our business without the stress of hosting issues.  "
Edge Hosting,www.edgehosting.com,Tim Baldwin,"Wednesday, January 25, 2012",Edge Web Hosting has always been prompt with a reply and solution to whatever trouble or questions I've had.
Edge Hosting,www.edgehosting.com,Tim McGovern,"Wednesday, January 25, 2012","We've worked with Edge Web Hosting for 5 years now and had a consistently positive experience. We reached out to them initially when we had a short window to prepare for an expected traffic spike. They quickly integrated with our team and added a lot of value in the process of getting us ready for our traffic spike.  Ever since then, Edge Web Hosting has helped us capitalize on opportunities that required hosting expertise. I highly recommend Edge Web Hosting to anyone looking for hosting expertise."
Edge Hosting,www.edgehosting.com,Tim McGuire,"Tuesday, January 24, 2012","I have been spoiled by Edge Web, they make me look good! I have been using them for all our hosting needs for about 10 years now. I would recommend Edge Web to anybody but my competition! I have never lost any revenue with them. Over the years I have never thought of switching, I get calls/emails depending on how I wish to be notified, saying that my software had a problem they restarted sophos or some technical jargon I don't need to understand and all is good so I can go back to bed. I go back to sleep as they continue to monitor my site and I sleep well knowing they are hard at work.  They are always up and the personal service far exceeds what I would expect even from an employee. I can call them day and night if something comes up and they already know about it, no long hold times. I can email them, submit tickets or call. They are always available and I have never even been told I need to escalate this or look into it further. There has never been any downtime longer than a few minutes and again it has never been a hardware failure just my software acting up from time to time. I dont know how they do it."
Edge Hosting,www.edgehosting.com,Ron Kerr,"Wednesday, January 11, 2012","Edgewebhosting has provided outstanding service and support for servers for years.

Edge Hosting,www.edgehosting.com,Christopher Keane,"Friday, December 16, 2011","I've been working with the excellent team at Edge for more than ten years. We started with a single shared hosting account for less than fifty dollars a month. Today, we have multiple dedicated servers under management at Edge. Not once in ten years has Edge disappointed me. Ever. It's tremendously reassuring to know that when I call with a question or a problem - whether it's a simple IIS setting or a new proposal for a Web cluster - their staff will treat me with respect and approach my problem as if it were their own. When I think of Edge, I think ""reliable""; reliable services and reliable people. "

Hostiso,hostiso.com,Thomas Beccari,"Thursday, September 17, 2015","Since 7 years I have to cope with Servers, Hosting, discussion boards etc. Starting as a newbie with some basic skills I developed to a kind of self taught admin but far from being an expert. During this time I experienced different kind of skill and service levels with different hosting companies. Some were bad from the beginning, other promised a lot and kept it for a certain time but became worse. There were fast and slow reaction times. Qualified and less qualified support members. But never I had such an outstanding company like Hostiso in all those years. After more than a year their support is on the same high level. No matter what time or support member. They often reply even to minor problems and low priority tickets faster than neccessary. And always kind even if you ask some stupid things. :-)Hostiso gives webmaster the possibility to concentrate on the essentials by taking care of all technical aspects of the biz. Servers are working on a constant high level. No outage or speed loss. Until I switched to Hostiso I dreamt about a company like them. Now I found them and I have no intention to change anymore, instead I will move all my webrelated services to them. "

Webservio,www.webservio.com,Michael Neff,"Monday, April 13, 2015","I was with Infinity/Locknet when they sold off to Webservio. My first question mark with Webservio occurred when they tried to lock me into a year long contract of service that included a proviso at the end of the absurdly long contract  that by signing it I was giving them permission to use my web content however they saw fit. I would not sign it, no way, and they dropped it. Things seemed to go okay for around a year until quite suddenly I lost all FTP contact with my domains. Next, my email was cut off from the server. One of my websites with a CMS went down and blank. After nearly tearing my hair out with Webservio tech support (which I was later to learn was just one person: the owner) who were not helping me solve the problem despite days of mails exchanged, I hired two programmers to go into the server and solve the issues. Webservio claimed hackers attacked my website and I needed to upgrade my entire system to stop them, but my programmers said otherwise. Somehow, a port was blocked in my Plesk interface that disallowed all my email from routing to me, and the other programmer learned that Webservio had updated the PHP that crashed my CMS, but Webservio denied having made a single change to the server and insisted it was hackers. I realized then I had to escape these people by any means necessary, and I did, thank God!!! All of this is carefully documented and I welcome any private contacts concerning Webservio. Please mail me at writerworkshops (at) earthlink.net. "

LocBox,www.locbox.com,Cinde,"Friday, February 6, 2015","Our experience started out somewhat good with LocBox, but when our company needed to make a move and so we cut out all 'extra' cost during and for a period after the move., this is when the problems really started. Don't tell them that you don't want their services any more!!!!! During a campaign they gave 'starbuck's' card for doing a review on our company But when we put our account on hold, since we where no longer 'paying' they would not honor sending out the 'starbucks' gift cards...even tho the review was done during the campaign and when we were paying. Then when I tried to contact the company to talk with them, no one would responded. And their stats are great in the presentation, but you really need to know YOUR market. It wasn't until the third campaign did we break even. I would use extreme caution when hearing their 'pitch'"
LocBox,www.locbox.com,Alexis Denning,"Monday, November 3, 2014","There are way better, cheaper products out there. Locbox way over pitches their product.

The more that I consult with clients on QuickBooks, the more that I am finding that I need to let QuickBooks do the accounting and other systems do the business work flow. Method CRM allows me to bring the whole package to my clients. When we started introducing Method CRM to our clients, it really opened their eyes to being able to have integrated systems and not having to duplicate their efforts. Method CRM has a flawless two way sync engine that will update the customer information in either system. With this we have been able to tailor the system for the things that their employees needed to see. Being able to customize Method CRM has opened doors for us that were impossible to do just with QuickBooks alone. QuickBooks along with Method CRM is definitely a winning combination.  It is amazing how we can help our clients with all of their business needs. "

Our school has successfully used ThinkWave for several years, and we recently switched to their web-based program. Not only do our teachers enjoy the increased accessibility of the program, but our students and parents love the fact that they can look up their grades at their own convenience. The program is convenient and easy to use, with helpful features such as the ability to carry the students, teachers, and other settings and information over to the consecutive school year."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Hank Watras,"Thursday, July 3, 2014","I was with them when they were DPS. paying $185/month for supposedly superlative and excellent and etc. back up at the recommendation of my IT person. Turns out he never verified the back ups so I have no idea whether good or not. Price creep has the price now at $448/month!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? So I went to cancel the contract: can't they say, the ""evergreen clause"" requires me to pay for 6 more months. THESE GUYS ARE CROOKS in my opinion. DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Mike,"Tuesday, May 13, 2014","Vaultlogix is the ONLY way to go when it comes to Mission Critical back up. When you need to get your data back can you get it? That is the true question. With past back up company's the answer was NO. But the only time I needed to get data back with Vaultlogix guess what...I got it."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Jason,"Monday, March 25, 2013","Review of VaultLogix, after 15 months of use and counting. 1. Price - there are many other providers out there that are cheaper. The claim that VaultLogix is a business solution does not compensate for the extra expense. I would agree that a carbonite like solution is not appropriate for a business, but there are other solutions that are business class for much less money. As we have discovered, premium price,  does not necessarily mean premium service. 2. Convenience - When we started with them, our first three customers went fairly smooth. On our forth client, a significant flaw in the management portal was revealed to us. It had been explained to us that to add another client you would click the add client button but we got the following message ""the data vault where you are attempting to add a new client is not allowing new customers. For the new data vault location please contact VaultLogix customer support"". When we called them they did not know why we were getting this message, but we were given a second username/password and under that login we could add new customers. Then after some time that username and password would not allow a new account to be created. So over time how many different logins will we have to manage? Over the 15 months which we have used their software we have not seen an update to the client. Have there been no improvements made to their software for 15 months? 3. Customer Service  Given the lack of a central account for our clients and the excessive cost per GB. We resolved ourselves to find another solution. Weve since found a few other options that seem more suitable. When we reached out to our account rep, we were very surprised with the response. Rather than addressing the reasons why we where considering leaving, or trying to salvage the account we were told that we just automatically renewed for another year.  I suppose I should have suspected it, I had looked at the contract not that long ago and didn't see it, the renewal (which is of course absent in the Customer agreement and fee summary) was on the contract terms. Well, I guess they got me. I asked my rep if she was going to try to force a further 12 month commitment on me when I didn't like the service after 15 months of use.  After all, the original rep seemed to be easy going and nice.  The initial impression was this was a small business to small business sort of engagement.  The most she was willing to do was to send me a copy of my contract. After all Sir, most of the Cell phone providers have contracts like these, Im sure any lawyer would find no fault in it.  I think that Cellular providers hardly set the high water mark for customer service. In summation, if your looking at VaultLogix, I would recommend you keep looking. "
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Ramona Davison,"Tuesday, January 15, 2013","I have a small, one woman business, focused almost entirely on online customers. I don't have a huge IT room with trained staff, or even many places to store paper and ink documents. Which is why I started looking for a back up host. The idea of cloud technology has always made me feel uneasy. But after reading up on it, I started to realize that in many ways, it's actually safer than just keeping those records myself (digitally or hard copies). Vault Logix has been one of the best investments I've made into my business. They automate everything, including their back up schedules, which has eliminated my one-time frequent problem of starting to do something, getting distracted, and forgetting to go back to it. My computer is no longer being over stressed because I don't need the hundred software downloads and massive quantity of memory to keep track of everything. Same goes for restore points, even though I know they're crucial. I always put them off, not wanting to take the time to do it - back ups took hours on my own computer.  VaultLogix does it all for me, by set frequency, and then keeps it all for me over there and not here. The interface was not at all as daunting as I feared it would be, and they have excellent customer service. No-one has ever sounded bored or irked when I called with what were probably very stupid questions. They took the complication out of it, leaving me time to focus on my actual work.  Best part - 24 hour service, that doesn't make you sit through a 30 minute recording. There are real, live people, and they know what they're talking about. They don't shuffle you around to ten different people who you then have to re-explain things to. I honestly could not be more pleased (and grateful) for how much they've simplified my life, and my work.  "
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,United Way,"Tuesday, September 4, 2012","Since 2004, we have relied on VaultLogix online remote backup service to securely transport and store our mission-critical data off-site every night. Because our data is encrypted and transmitted over the internet, we can quickly and easily restore data online 24-7. Their staff have been extremely knowledgeable and helpful and we now feel that we can survive any emergency involving our data systems."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Steve A.,"Saturday, April 21, 2012","VaultLogix has earned the trust of our firm after a thorough evaluation of off-site computer data backup providers. The service automatically records all changes to data files on our entire server every night after normal working hours, and gives us a report the following morning to confirm that the backup functioned properly.Over the years we have gone through the usual progression of backup methods - floppy disks, to Zip disks, to taking disks home each evening, trips to the bank safe deposit box, to various tape backup systems. None of these methods have offered the safety, security, ease of operation, and automatic operation benefits that VaultLogix' service has. I can concentrate on doing my Architectural work now instead of spending part of each day doing computer backup work and worrying if the backup worked properly.VaultLogix maintains the hardware and provides us with the software and technical advice to get us started on a worry-free method to back up our data regularly and confidently. If a file is erased accidentally or becomes unusable for any reason, VaultLogix makes it easy to recover the lost data in a matter of minutes.The VaultLogix Support Department is always available when needed; yet they do not disturb our regular business operations. Changes to the service, or scheduled maintenance to their equipment are announced ahead of time. Should I miss a regular backup because a machine has been turned off or failed, VaultLogix Support contacts us."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Fred S,"Friday, February 17, 2012","I have had nothing but a great experience with VaultLogix.  Their product does exactly what it is advertised to do.  Their technical support was outstanding, even helping me fix some configuration issues with my SQL Server implementation.  Product is very ease to use, and allows me to configure a number of different backup jobs with different schedules and retention periods.  Set it up and done, no more backup worries!"
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Mike R,"Friday, January 27, 2012","I signed a contract with them. The portal is very poorly implemented. Tech support takes days. The overall product is less than robust. Further review of the contract waives them of any liability, and there are no servicel level agreements within the contract to hold them to. I'm stuck with it until the end of the contract term, but never again. Shame on me. Don't let it happen to you."
VaultLogix,www.dataprotection.com,Perry Sterling,"Sunday, October 2, 2011",Very disatisfied with the overall product and service.

Dropbox,www.dropbox.com,Will Talbot,"Thursday, January 8, 2015","The best part of dropbox is the auto-upload of iphone camera photos via the app to your cloud account.

He has uploaded years of his music, archived photographs from as far back as the 1960s and provided an interesting experience for visitors, and he had over 6 million since the sites inception.

I cannot even list all of the problems we have had with them over the years and we seem to be reporting problems on a monthly basis. Their support is awful and predictable. We contact them with a problem, they say that there is no problem, we then have to prove there is a problem and then they say oops! Looks like there is a problem; unfortunately many are never fixed.

In the decision making process Solid Commerce launched a series of webinars. This is a great asset as we have quite a few offsite team members and this tool will allow us to train our team and keep them up to speed.

Avangate  assured me I could only receive my refund after letting PayPal know that we had resolved our differences. After I did that NO MORE RESPONSE FROM AVANGATE.  It turns out that once you let PayPal know that the issue is resolved you cannot open it again.  Avangate played me like a fiddle.  Avoid this company at all costs.

Last month I went through the renewal process with BitDefender, which I found to be clunky and seriously over-complicated. I now find that this renewal was processed through Avangate, who have taken AU$160 in two invoices from my Paypal account for a product which should have cost around AU$60. When I tried to query this with Avangate, they said that this was not their problem and that I should contact BitDefender. I pointed out that since Avangate  have taken my money, my contract is with them, but they refused to address this point and when I eventually asked for the contact details for their legal department, simply repeated their stock answer about contacting BitDefender. I have contacted BitDefender and, somewhat predictably, have received no reply at all. Think very carefully before doing business with either of these two companies."

TransferWise,www.transferwise.com,Matthew,"Monday, May 18, 2015","I have to admit I was skeptical about this service, but I did some research and determined it was legitimate.  I compared the rates to USForex, Xoom, and XE, and Transferwise was the best.  I looked over the site thoroughly and decided to use it.  I sent dollars to Norway using a direct debit and it took 4 days.   You just put in your bank info the the recipient's bank info.  I got the rate that they said it would be, even though the knorer gained 2% in those 4 days.  I used a referral link that gives you your first transaction (up to $4500) free and so I paid no fees at all.  I am quite satisfied with it."
TransferWise,www.transferwise.com,Kathleen Emerson,"Tuesday, January 27, 2015","I'm very dissatisfied. I wanted to send the payment via direct debit, but apparently you can't send direct debits to Transferwise from Bank of America (which is a bit ridiculous, what with Bank of America being so ubiquitous). So I had to pay $3 to make a transfer from BoA. It wasn't made clear to me that I wouldn't be getting the rate available at the time I set up the payment, but would get the rate at the time my money arrived. If this had been made clear to me, since I'm very risk averse, I never would have made the transfer. For example, on the right hand side of this very screen it says ""Amount: 2,000.93 GPB"" which is not what you'd give me if the money arrived right now - this is deeply misleading and I do feel I have been deceived by Transferwise. I'm a poor student and although this debacle has only cost me $6, I wasted a lot of time calling my bank and calling Transferwise, and I'm very frugal so $6 is really non-trivial to me, when I'm using this service in the first place to save every penny. I will not be recommending Transferwise to my friends - quite the contrary."
TransferWise,www.transferwise.com,Peter,"Monday, June 16, 2014","I can certainly recommend Transferwise. We used to use XE.com but we have used Transferwise several times now and gave a much better rate both times. I have also compared with moneycorp and currencyfair and transferwise has a better rate even after the 0.5% commission. The money was even deposited into our account abroad the same day on one occasion. No registration was needed or ID documentation to send to the company and you can transfer from your bank account or simply pay with your debit card up to 3000 as we did, a lot more simple that any other method we have used in the past. "

Zenefits,www.zenefits.com,Angelica Smith,"Thursday, October 20, 2016","Save yourself from using this company.  The program is loaded with glitches.  Guaranteed you will find nothing but problems whether with payroll, insurance sign up, and their New dashboard (Z2) is absolutely useless.  They list employees pictures and names before the actual areas that need to be managed day to day...such a waste, completely useless.  There is absolutely Nothing positive that I can think of...I am seriously disappointed and if it was up to me I would have the company go back to ADP.  I used them over the years (I help to start small businesses) and never had issues, if a payrun was forgotten or late by an hour they ALWAYS pulled through and ran it.  Zenefits has a dead set cut-off time and absolutely will not grant not even if you are late by an hour!  Completely not a business friendly service.  Very upsetting to say the least.  "
Zenefits,www.zenefits.com,Chelsea,"Wednesday, June 22, 2016","For a company with less than 10 employees, it makes sense to use automated software. The problems arise when the software stops working and forces you to talk to a real person to get things going again. Last year, they screwed up our benefits and didn't put us on the zero deductible plan - never fixed it either. This year, we switched insurance carriers and we've had to restart the process 3 times, pushing back the benefits start date each time. I have appointments and surgeries to keep rescheduling and this is just getting ridiculous. It doesn't help that our reps are near impossible to reach and they notify us of deadlines just hours before a submission is due."

Zenefits,www.zenefits.com,Joe Schappler,"Tuesday, January 19, 2016","I really liked the Benefits platform and was excited to switch over.  Unfortunately the implementation has been a disaster, with silence seeming to be the choice to resolve issues. Our healthcare was quoted incorrectly, resulting in a massive increase beyond reason. The payroll switch has been filled with issues.  Information on our personal sites is filled with incorrect data, wrong phone numbers for our healthcare providers, etc.  Maybe it's growing pains and they'll improve over time.  But the customer service, always full of apologies, is incompetent, or overworked, or inexperienced. Months into this process and it's not going smoothly at all. I do not recommend until they improve their thoroughness and competency."

However, since then, we've tried to communicate with their team on multiple occasions and our communication (emails and voicemail) seem to go into a black hole.  We've  attempted to contact them no less than 10 times in the last 6 weeks and have had no response.  We didn't even get a courtesy reply that they had received it and when we might expect to hear back from them.   It seems that they have mastered the art of acquiring the customer, but when it comes to keeping the customer, for us, it remains to be seen.  If you're considering using them, I'd wait 3 - 6 months and revisit the reviews again to see if they've made any improvements."

The set up was easy and the service so far has been excellent and I love the new platform for its ease of use.  We got everyone loaded and new plan choices were made and everyone was enrolled on time!!!My employees really like the onboarding process and having all the benefit information in a portal that they can log in to anytime and everything is right there in one place.  Also, when an employee leaves the company, the COBRA set up is extremely quick and easy too.

I ended up signing up on the same day because this is exactly what I was looking for. One of the amazing things is......IT IS FREE!!!The next big thing is implementation. It was so easy because of the person helping me. Her name was Katherine. She makes sure that everything is doing right with the implementation process via phone or email. She is responsive and easy to communicate with. This is also a perfect timing for us to have Zenefits, since I was about to change insurance broker and Robert was able to answer all my questions.

The new hires just need to enter their information once, and it populates all the forms, such as W4, I9, etc.  I can also have the employee manual and all our software tutorials sent directly to the new hires.  This definitely is a time saver!  So far the health insurance piece  has been great as well.  We did have a couple of minor issues, but they were resolved in a timely manner, with a great deal of communication from Zenefits.  I am looking forward to see how open enrollment goes!

Great concept but have grown so quickly that they continue to have problems with calculating accurately paychecks of all of our employees since we started with them. Since we have started with them, they have screwed up my personal accounts (not to mention most people in our company) 1. DCA (screwed up contribution for 1 month..deducted money but not added to account)2. 401K (took them 3 months to transfer it from our company to theirs, gave access to all of our accounts to 3. Commuter Benefit4. Health Insurance5. HSAAnd once again, after having my paycheck be correct for 1 pay period, it is now no longer correct. They have once again screwed up my HSA account.Again, think twice about using this company, the stress they add to your employees from a pay period to pay period not knowing if their paycheck is correct...is not worth it."

They are far better than previous outsourced HR services that we've used in the past, while being much more cost effective. As with the implementation of a system as far reaching as Zenefits, we anticipated some transition pains, but our implementation manager is amazing. They were able to immediately and thoroughly answer questions. They were available to me instantly and have responded quickly every time we had a question.

I used to have spreadsheets, pdfs, word docs, insurance forms and the hiring process used to be a spiderweb of isolated units. With Zenefits they are all centralized and synced with payroll.  Hiring people takes me less than 3 minutes now and our employees can all self-enroll in health and disability insurance. Employees manage their own information, including adding dependents, requesting PTO,  changing their address, changing their bank info for payroll, etc. It's free, customer service is solid and the application user experience and interface are great.I should give the disclaimer that my company helped them with their branding, but my review is completely independent of our experience working with Zenefits."

That's a pretty stressful thing for people, which is what Zenefits is aimed to reduce.* First payroll with Zenefits wasn't ready and required manual checks to be cut directly from our company."

Incompetent and seemingly understaffed technical support, a product that perhaps, under the right circumstances just might work for someone.   Nasty customer service people.   It took them 54 days to replace the 2 non functioning clocks they sold us, then they contended that we were outside the 30 day cancellation period.  One of the two replacement clocks never worked.  STAY AWAY from this company!!! "

We don`t seem to  matter to them since we don't receive answers to our questions or get correct information when we do. Our representative is very nice but always comes up with excuses as too why things are wrong. Use another software company or even do it yourself...you'll have better luck!

I submitted a question regarding UIA rates 3 weeks ago and still haven't received an answer. While you do have a dedicated customer service rep that person has to go to the tax department, implementation department, benefits department to get answers for you and those departments are way understaffed.

They do not tell you that you need to elect dental if you want coverage for it, since they give you no option for that.  Then they did not tell the insurance company about my insurance coverage until I called to find out why I received a bill from a doctor visit.  Two months later and week of phone calls I finally got it straightened out.  The easy part in this process was calling the insurance company themselves, not the cobra company."

Paylocity,www.paylocity.com,Jessica Cotton,"Tuesday, March 22, 2016","Paylocity's WEBPAY works well.  We only had one issue regarding the state calculation of taxes for a small group of people for 2 years in a row.  The state tax tables had not changed nor their rates but the employees deduction from check did.  Other than that, the simple payroll processing has been good.  The customer service aspect has not been great at all.  Not sure if we have been unlucky with our service reps or if it is an overall company issue.  However, we have had MANY issues with the WEBTIME system and are looking at other systems now.   We use biometric clocks, rounding, and enforced scheduling (employees cannot punch in or out unless within their assigned schedule).  We have had schedules all of a sudden drop off with no reason, which does not allow our employees to clock in.  This is a repeating issue year after year.  More recently, we currently have calculation errors in regular and OT hours, unable to edit time sheet due to error messages, and more.   When we try to get it resolved, we have no direct access to the people fixing it and this has been going on for 4 weeks now with no known time when this issue will be resolved.  If you use web punching, we have not had any issues with this."

It was more than a week before i found out from an employee who was dropped.  When I notified BM, they said it would take 4-5 business days.  They had to get permission to process faster.  No follow ups unless I called them. They didn't have a customer service urgency to seeing that their negligence was corrected.  Still waiting on follow-up about a COBRA issue.  No customer service urgency to follow-up.  I have to call them.  2 - stars for being able to enter my own employees and that they loaded to Care First in a timely fashion."

Remind you they didn't realize this until almost 60 days after they were due!!  They then mailed me the reports to do myself which took an entire day of writing letters, printing checks, and mailing myself. Oh, and it cost over $100 to mail out which they REFUSE to refund us.  In all, the company spents $1000's in attorney fees and hourly wages to fix everything PrimePay had done...to include the numerous letters for penalties and fees that continue to come almost 9 months later.

180Fusion,www.180fusion.com,Allen Keele,"Tuesday, October 25, 2016","We are trying out 108Fusion now. We signed on a month ago with a $1,000 setup fee, and initially committed to a 6-month run on a single ""theme"" of keywords, and promotion of a single landing page for nearly $1,700 per month. The first month had to be pre-paid along with the setup fee. It took a week of scheduling work just to get my initial account exec, ""Josh"", on a get-acquainted call. In the first call, Josh quickly informed me he had not reviewed any of my preliminary survey information submitted as part of the on-boarding process because he felt it would simply be better to ""get the information in my own words"". He also explained he has no understanding or familiarity of Joomla, which is our web-platform. In other words, I had wasted my time completing the on-boarding process, and he was calling me with no preparation or qualification. I immediately requested a replacement. That took another week. I had a much better call with the second account manager, Briton, which was 10 days ago. However, I can find no record of any actual work whatsoever. We track all administrative access and activities on our site, and 180Fusion has not opened a single page of content or made a single modification in my first month with them. They logged in once just to test access, but then left without doing anything. Google Analytics does not show any new domain backlinks from link-building efforts. 180Fusion has not provided any activity report. My 180Fusion client portal shows no domains for my account. So far, the only activity I am sure of is the processing of our credit card for nearly $2,700.00. I hope to update with a report of improvement later, but it's looking really sketchy so far."

I was already charged for that month so I let it go. I was promised they will make changes... AGAIN THERE were NO RESULTS for the month after they claimed 'everything looks much better on their side. At the end of the ""extended"" month I called to let them know this was it, just to find out they continue to charge my card. I had to dispute charges through my credit card.

Sellsy,www.sellsy.com,Frederic MARTINET,"Tuesday, August 27, 2013","I use Sellsy from the beginning. I choose that CRM website for my architectural office. It changed totally that boring part of my job, and reduced the time I spend on it. I advise it to my friends architects, graphists and designers."
Sellsy,www.sellsy.com,You Immo,"Tuesday, August 27, 2013","Just great. We use their service since the inception of our company. Reactivity and excellent services are technologically advanced. Their website is really excellent. Our network will include hundreds of negotiators also because they are technically excellent, we chose. All our billing was given to Sellsy."
Sellsy,www.sellsy.com,Fred Martin,"Friday, August 23, 2013","We're very happy with Sellsy.

We especially like the Helpdesk add-on, a powerful tool to manage our client requests."
AccuPOS,www.accupos.com,MARK,"Tuesday, November 18, 2014","Accupos is by far the worst company I have dealt with. Every time you call them with a problem or question, you must first wait on hold for at least a half hour, sometimes closer to 45 minutes. After the long wait  you usually get a technician that can't help you. So after the 30 min. wait on hold you have 30 min. tied up with an inferior technician. After all that you get transferred to the right guy to fix your problems with their system that obliviously wasn't engineered to work with your accounting software like it is supposed to. Our business is overall very dissatisfied with the customer service at Accupos."
AccuPOS,www.accupos.com,Nate,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","I purchased this product with the hope of using it for a new bar concept. First off their sales team are liars. I was sold a ton of features that appeared in the demos, but then were completely absent in the product. Then while trying to get the application to work, their support was completely unable to get their own product to work on a brand new $2,000 server. I even completely reloaded the computer per their request and they were still completely unable to get their product to work. I had to move the software from a $2000 custom built server to a $250 laptop to get it to work, and when I say work I mean crash every 10 minutes. Then 2 nights before I opened my doors they discovered that they did not send me any printers that could print credit card receipts?  What!!!  I had to go through my two grand opening nights swiping carbon copy credit card slips.  All the time they were telling me they were overnighting me a printer. Do you think that printer showed up. Nope. Then I tried to return the product because it was completely useless and they would not take back the hardware. They then said they would refund the software price and then they lied about that. They charged a 20% restocking fee and just didn't bother to refund 3 of the 5 licenses I bought. This company is full of liars, cheats and plainly clueless individuals. I would under no circumstances buy any product of any sort from this company.  You will be taken for a ride. Feel free to email me for any further details, or just be smart and do something else. Seriously Angry."
Bindo POS,www.bindopos.com,John ,"Tuesday, June 23, 2015","We had been using another iPad POS for nearly a year and our 4 employees all hated the various IT issues, glitches, and poor customer support. Despite this, we were hesitant to switch to Bindo since we already had all our tools and features set-up and customized. After a few frustrating weeks with our incompetent system, we were finally convinced to give Bindo a try. After trying out their free trial, we fell in love with their interface and features, and we immediately made the switch. The sales and support team were very helpful in migrating our data such as inventory information. Honestly, I don't know why we didn't switch sooner! "
Bindo POS,www.bindopos.com,Harry S.,"Tuesday, June 23, 2015","Our small store carries a variety of products so managing it was a chore for me and my assistant. Since we switched from our cash register to Bindo's POS system, we've save dozens of hours on inventory management. This system has not only helped solve our POS and card processing needs, but has also helped us with managing many aspects of our business that we couldn't before. Highly recommend for businesses with messy stock rooms or intensive inventory management needs!"
LivePOS,www.livepos.com,Giro Bulyen,"Tuesday, October 18, 2016",LivePOS has been working like a charm for us and it's been more than a year now. Very much satisfied with this POS. Would recommend it.

Aralco,www.aralco.com,Jennifer,"Monday, August 18, 2014","I have used Aralco Inventory Management and POS systems since 1993.Ease-of-use: The Point of Sale is easy to follow for a novice or an experienced retail person. It can handle split currency, and opening and closing is very straightforward. The Back Office is straightforward. Reports are easy to produce, giving you lots of variations to specially customize them to meet your needs.Functionality: It gives me all the reports I need to do analysis on the retail business.Product Quality: There are a few minor details that can be fixed, but overall, quality is very good, and it's easy to use.Customer Support: There is usually someone there right away to help. And if the initial person can't answer your question, they will ask for help from a more senior person.Likes Best: The POS is very easy to learn, especially for first time users. I like the fact that it is a Canadian company based in BC. I also like that you can get through to a real person on the help line quite quickly. Also, most of the Aralco staff have been there for quite a few years so they are very familiar with all aspects of the software and can help very quickly.Recommendations: I have been using Aralco retail software since 1993 and have recommended it to many others. I have seen many retail software companies come and go, and Aralco is still here for the long term.The software is user-friendly and reasonably priced. It has all the features needed to run a single store or a multi-store chain. I am excited about their new e-commerce integration with the Back Office software. I plan to implement this in 2014."

"CORESense, Inc.",www.coresense.com,Kyle,"Saturday, April 21, 2012","I have been using CORESense for the past 3 years and use it to run two websites and my retail store and my experience has been very good. I used to manage everything with different software applications and now I can do it with one solution. Their implementation was very knowledgeable and helpful getting things up and running and ongoing support is fantastic. I can actually call and speak to someone in the United States when I have a problem. You dont get that from many software vendors today.  I have not experienced any down time nor major software issues. Like any tool this powerful you need to take the time to learn how it works and if you do you will be rewarded greatly. CORESense has always been responsive to any requests/issues, etc. I would recommend them to anyone serious about growing their business.  "
Groovv,www.groovv.com,Richard Malone,"Friday, April 17, 2015","The customer sales person & his manager lied about what the groovv POS system was actual capable of doing.  I asked if it provided next day funding & they both said yes.  The groovv system cannot provide next day funding.  It batches at 2am and it will take at least 36 hours for funds to reach your account.  After letting them know that they did not tell the truth about their product & that I wanted to cancel my contract, they told me that I would have to pay an early termination fee of $295.  The credit card reader also stopped working two days after I got it.  They never called to help set up the system as well.  Do not waste your time with this company!!! "

Hike,www.hikepos.com,Darren Clark,"Wednesday, February 3, 2016","Take up the trial and definitely should be in your top 3 considerations for POS systems.

Since I didn't realize that they had changed their name, I've evidently sent their emails to my spam folder with tons of other junk that I get.  Anyway, they tell me that it would cost over $200 to ""retrieve it/renew it"" or I can wait 30 days and just buy it again for about $20.  It didn't make me very happy -but the customer service rep didn't care...  I can understand a fee...but $180???  If I repurchase the domain name -it won't be thru them!"

Promys,www.promys.com,Dominic Docherty,"Friday, May 16, 2014"," I looked at all the major PSA/Business software solutions before selecting PROMYS. Most were strong at managing the Help Desk, tracking work assignments and Time Sheets, but PROMYS was the only solution that was equally strong in CRM, Quoting, Project Management, Project Costing and tracking customer inventory/assets under support contract, along with the traditional PSA Service Management functionality. That strength across our different lines of business was really important to us, since the majority of our customers are looking for a one stop shop, an IT solution provider partner who can provide them with Cloud solutions, Managed Services, Project based solutions, as well as break-fix support. PROMYS allows us to service our customers equally well in all of those different areas. "
Promys,www.promys.com,Israel Labadie,"Friday, May 16, 2014","Pros: Real-time visibility into: - Project profitability (mid-project cost against budget) - Resource utilization - Resource forecasting Powerful reporting analytics for: - Margin (by Manufacturer, Line of Business, by Customer, etc.) - Labor Analysis - Revenue, Margin & Labor forecasting Responsive Customer Service: - Very good response and resolve times - Very knowledgeable implementation and support staffCons: Multi-language support could be better (2014 version is supposed to address this).Overall: Having real-time visibility into project profitability, resource utilization and resource forecasting has allowed us to stay on top of current projects, both from a customer satisfaction and project profitability perspective, as well as better plan for future projects."
Promys,www.promys.com,Rich Truche,"Friday, May 16, 2014","Pros: Fantastic margin reporting and analytics across projects, customers and products Very strong Project Management and Labor Analysis capabilities Good Help Desk and Service Contract management functionality Proactive customer support Very structured implementation approach that drove industry best practices and user adoption Cons: Integration with Sage X3 is very strong, but took slightly longer than expected Initially it was hard to get our executive team to look at PROMYS because it's less well known than the big two PSA's. Overall: In another life I was a power user of one of the more heavily marketed PSA's, so I'm very familiar with that tools capabilities. We did a very deep dive evaluating PROMYS compared to several other solutions. It was clear very early in the evaluation, that for a Cisco Gold partner our size, PROMYS was a far better fit than traditional PSA's. PROMYS is significantly stronger from a forecasting & planning perspective and provides far better visibility into mid-project profitability. Margin and profitability reporting are in a completely different class. PROMYS didn't just ""win"" our PSA evaluation, for a business our size, the traditional PSA's weren't even options any more."

This not only virtualy elminates re-keying info, it provides management with excellent real-time visibility into all aspects of the business.

They engaged with the key players in my organization to understand our company and tailored the PROMYS configuration to our specific needs. "
Promys,www.promys.com,Michael Lynsday,"Friday, May 16, 2014","We selected the Promys PSA software in order to help us make profitable growth decisions by providing real-time visibility into resource and revenue forecasting, mid-project profitability and detailed company margin analytics. The Managed IT Service solutions that we deliver to our clients allow them to focus on their core competencies and leave managing their IT infrastructure to us. But in our own business, our previous business software (Connectwise) was becoming a distraction to running our business. Instead of the business enabler we had hoped for when first implemented, slow system response and support issues were consuming way too much time and attention. We have very aggressive growth plans so we needed to select a system that would not only support our current needs, but one that would handle the increasing complexity of our company as our growth continues. With Promys, we know that no matter how aggressively we grow, we wont outgrow our software infrastructure, so now we can go back to focusing on growing and managing our business, as opposed to managing our business software."

ProWorkflow,www.ProWorkflow.com,Christina Rookes,"Monday, November 10, 2014",First Class ServiceOur company has been using ProWorkflow as the office management system over the past few months. It has been a useful tool in creating efficiency in managing and running our increasing number of projects. Part of establishing efficient management has involved making changes to the format of the project templates. Our adviser at PWF has listening to our requirements and ensured that the implementation of changes is accurate and implemented speedily. An example of this was a change undertaken which had a turn around of less than 24 hours. We were very impressed as in the initial discussion we were informed that the person involved was going on leave the next day. The work was done immediately so we didnt have to wait.

I would like to see some further improvements in the future in the way we can manage time and team, especially the link towards agenda management. That said, I am really very pleased with this tool, and will certainly keep using it.  The customer service is also A.

ProWorkflow,www.ProWorkflow.com,Sarah Girvan,"Monday, August 20, 2012","ProWorkFlow V8 has taken our business's productivity to the next level. The flexibility of the time tracking, through to the 'smart ordering' on projects and enhanced reporting are invaluable, and also enjoyable - the whole team try to 'outdo' each other on demonstrating how many hours they can track in a day! The quoting, invoicing and integration with Xero means that we can gather invaluable performance data easily and quickly.The transparency for our clients is a huge bonus, with clients often commenting on how rare it is to get detailed and accurate time tracking reports - especially for those clients on regular monthly retainers. Lastly, the personal and often immediate customer service response is outstanding, thanks Richard, Julian and co, keep it up :)"

After using several disappointing so called project management solutions over the past 10 years we were keen to get it right this time. We tested 9 software solutions, and decided on ProWorkflow. We were fortunate to have been able to start using the beta V.8 and have found the new U.I. very easy to use. The staff have mentioned the many further improvements they are busy working on, all sound very exciting and will answer our remaining list of must haves...One feature I am very keen to see improved further is the timeline planning tools, which I have been told is noted for a possible upgrade. This is something we would use daily to keep everything on schedule so would be something we would be happy to pay extra for so the developers can really make it sing, perhaps like the invoice and quoting add-ons, so users can have an option.Easy user interface, simple feature set, value for money, awesome technical support staff and a solid future development plan."

The latest version of their software (aptly called V8) has taken an already great product and made it faster, easier to use and with a pinch of new features to help make project, capacity planning and communication even easier. However we did not just buy a software package  we gained access to real people who actually care and actually listen. They make support fun  and when have you ever said that about support? Do I recommend ProWorkflow? You bet."

The price is great, especially considering how advanced the tools are and the service has been outstanding. What's more, our staff actually like using it, which is a huge bonus from an implementation point of view.

Wrike Inc.,www.wrike.com,Bernabe Torres Campo,"Friday, January 22, 2016","Wrike is a great way to organize your company. The two best things about it I think are that it's very customizable and collaborative. You can be fully transparent or fully confidential with your projects as well as having all the custom fields and things you want to keep track of in your work. It's also fully collaborative where tons of people can work on a project, assigning tasks, to do lists, bigger projects, etc. Full compatibility with Google Apps, we use it a lot for sharing Google Drive files. It almost has like a social network feel to it. Also don't forget to use Dashboards and Reports to keep you on your toes on your tasks and productivity. "

Wrike Inc.,www.wrike.com,Kristin Lanphier,"Monday, July 20, 2015",Wrike is really great project management tool that allows you to really customize and use the tool that best suites your organization and needs. It's good at being diverse so you are able to use it across departments and by task needs - although it does sometimes require a little creativity on how to make everything work and function. The tool has developed over time with new features (which is great that the company takes user feedback into consideration and makes changes) that have helped create better efficiencies for our company. The big downsize for me is that the tool doesn't have built in time allotments; you can track your time for tasks but you can't budget time on a task before someone starts. There is also nothing about departments so scheduling and making sure one team isn't swamped or overworked can be challenging. 
Wrike Inc.,www.wrike.com,Melissa Mathews,"Friday, July 17, 2015",We use Wrike in our marketing department. It's been very helpful to track projects and it's very intuitive to use. It's free to try and the help line is extremely supportive. Wrike blends the perfect amount of usefulness without getting too bloated by unnecessary gadgets and tracking.

While it sounds a little cliche, I haven't found something that I wanted to do/organize that I couldn't do on Wrike. It allows for nested, upon nested sub tasks, timeline views, priority management, time clocking, and awesome collaboration. The feature I use most to keep on task is the Gantt chart view and folders. The only feature Wrike is lacking, setting notifications for a specific date/time. For example, if I want to be notified about a task on July 18th at 9:05 a.m. I cannot. "

It lacks in cost-management functionality and the scheduling functionality is somewhat limited compared to other products. Where it shines is in project collaboration and communication. It keeps your team working on the same page, keeps project-communications connected to project tasks, and allows supervisors to see all the work being done in an organization and who is working on what. It is intuitive enough to start using with no training, but still has a wealth of features for more advanced use cases.

The report options are countless and the continuity between screens makes it very easy to train new users. The Workamajig staff has a dedication to making the product better and better which can be seen in their updates to the software each month.

Workamajig,www.Workamajig.com,Bob,"Wednesday, April 9, 2014","Workamajig is a great software ONCE you figure out how to use it. There is a steep learning curve and  you really have to take your time to set up the back-end first. Make sure your accounting is properly set up first before you even begin training or using the software, otherwise you will be scrambling trying to fix things. The support at Workamajig is awful. I can't say enough about how poor their answers are via email. It is best to talk to them on the phone. They don't fully read your emails and when they finally do reply (several hours later), they often just send a link to the help menu. We call the help menu the 'terribly unhelpful menu' because it is so useless.  There is also one support rep who just laughs at you when you first ask a question. I've had it happen more than once. Not sure if that is a nervous thing or what but I find it quite rude. Overall, we found a way to get through the setup process because our owners said we were stuck with it but if you're reading these reviews, I would seriously consider another software program instead.

Glip,www.glip.com,Sean Marshall,"Tuesday, January 7, 2014","Glip has become integral to our team's daily communication. It does a great job of integrating multiple task management and sharing features that IM alone couldn't provide. I'm a big fan of being able to click on an old task, shared file or link and get dropped right back into the conversation that lead up to, and resulted from it.  "
Glip,www.glip.com,Keble,"Tuesday, January 7, 2014",I've spent most of my career in the agency space and tried many team collaboration tools.

Projects, issues, costs under control. Simply."

The initial implementation took some time but the clarizen support helped me with free webinars and great training. Clarizen is a great tool for communicating with my resources and updating my board members on status.
Ganttic LLC,www.ganttic.com,Anna,"Wednesday, January 2, 2013",This app is fabulous! It helps so much for our lab work. It manages perfectly for our multi-project scheduling and it is so convenient to share!
Ganttic LLC,www.ganttic.com,Jarek Wujkowsi,"Wednesday, December 19, 2012",Searching for a program similar to this for a small business is difficult. In fact I can't even find anything else out there like it. Would definitely recommend Ganttic LLc for any type of business owner.

HappyTodos,www.happytodos.com,Lisa Adams,"Tuesday, February 14, 2012","Overall, a nice tool, but there were a few irritating little features that prevent me from taking this tool further. You can comment on tasks (like Basecamp) But you have no idea of knowing of any unread messages, and you have to go ahead and open every single task just in case theres something there. Not fun."
HappyTodos,www.happytodos.com,Daniel Smallfield,"Saturday, February 11, 2012","Ive only just started using this tool, but it does seem to make things easier. Just being able to see straight away whats the status for each project, and being able to move tasks up and down makes it so much better than the Excels and Gantt charts I was using before. And its free!"
HappyTodos,www.happytodos.com,Andy Webber,"Wednesday, February 8, 2012","There are lots of project managers out there, each offering a slightly different spin on how to manage your projects. HappyTodos has a basic UI, which needs improving on, but the redeeming feature is the ability to focus your team on those 4-5 tasks they need to get done today. Will be interesting to see how it handles larger projects."
Mavenlink,www.mavenlink.com/,Kasim Aslam,"Friday, July 25, 2014","My business runs on Mavenlink.We're not the same business we were a year ago - using Mavenlink gave me the foundation and structure I needed to grow my company from a small disjointed creative agency to a truly scalable organization.

Mavenlink provides an amazing structure to project management that makes using the tool easy while keeping it malleable enough to adjust to suit our specific needs as an organization. It's a truly all encompassing project management utility. You can manage projects, finances, communication, collaboration, resources and Clients all from a single tool."

Copper Project,www.CopperProject.com,Thomas P,"Thursday, September 13, 2012","We've been using Copper for years now, and I have to say it has been one of the single most useful pieces of software for us. We don't use a lot of the reporting, but definitely use the gantt chart to quickly build out projects and project templates, and all staff know to ""put it in copper"" when adding time and comments. In short, if you're looking for a basecamp alternative, or something a little more sophisticated, Copper would have to be the hidden treasure you're looking for."
Copper Project,www.CopperProject.com,W. Ross Wells,"Wednesday, September 12, 2012","We started Zenfilm in Sept. '05. At that time good project management software for film and video  cost around 20k, so we looked for alternatives and we discovered Copper. The ability to implement fully featured project management so affordably  gave us a creative and competitive edge.  Our company (and our relationship with Copper Project) just turned 6. I hear the word ""Copper"" in the Zenfilm hallways 20 times a day, it's part of our company culture. It's how we make award-winning broadcast advertising, corporate content, and music videos with a small, tactical creative team. Bravo Copper!"
Advantage Software,www.gotoadvantage.com,Robert,"Thursday, August 20, 2015","This is not a package for smaller agencies. You should have someone with a strong accounting background on staff, and be prepared to have your account managers spend hours per day in the system. Out of the box it required a great deal of setup, adjustment and training to make it go. The Advantage staff was knowledgeable and responsive, but we are a year into our implementation and still scratching our heads too often as we figure out the finer points. Does it work? Yes. We can report on anything, which is what big agencies need. But we now spend 10 times what we did on software fees, and twice as long doing data entry. Way too much overhead for smaller agencies."
Advantage Software,www.gotoadvantage.com,Bryan Gwin,"Monday, April 7, 2014",Great advertising solution. Very impressed by how easy everything flowed after the initial signup and integration procedures. Still trying the product out as a whole but so far so good.

FunctionFox Systems Inc,www.FunctionFox.com,Rebecca,"Friday, October 30, 2015","I've been using TimeFox as a freelancer and I love it! Yes the interface is a little dated compared to others, but it's done so much to help me improve my business, and the customer service is amazing!"
FunctionFox Systems Inc,www.FunctionFox.com,suzanne nelson,"Thursday, January 15, 2015","Extremely cumbersome software and not logical at all. I am a very good at understanding and learning many applications such as InDesign, Word, Excel, Survey Monkey, Constant Contact, Deltek Vision, Dynamics CRM, Outlook and I teach myself everything I can to an advanced level. I like to know the in's and out's of the software I'm using. In all my years of working with software, TimeFox is by far the worst. You can't find anything. It doesn't make sense. Navigation is all over the place. I don't know if Function Fox has taken over the internet and removed all the negative reviews about their software ...but I'm telling you now. DON'T BUY IT!"
FunctionFox Systems Inc,www.FunctionFox.com,Peigi McGillivray,"Thursday, November 27, 2014","Really Useful Product at a Really Reasonable Price.I have used TimeFox in several ways: as an employee to record my time; as a production manager to develop estimates, manage projects, and streamline workflow; and as a freelancer to manage my time, keep clients informed, and simplify billing. Recording time with TimeFox is much easier and faster than filling in paper timesheets, and much more accurate, too, especially with its automatic timer feature. I found I was making fewer errors in posting time to projects myself, and because no one had to collate, interpret, and record our teams time, there were fewer errors overall. As production manager, I used TimeFox features such as estimating, the project blog, client and project reports, scheduling, and calendars, to manage projects and improve communications within our team and with clients. I was able to increase our billable hours, and because we were keeping better tabs on things, there were fewer disputes or questions from clients about bills. With people recording their time as they completed their tasks, I could keep on top of budgets better, and could see who was overloaded with work, and who had the capacity to take on more. I found TimeFox easy to scale up when new employees or contractors were needed and just easy to scale down again, when belt-tightening was the order of the day.    As a freelancer, I chose to use TimeFox because it gave me all the professional capabilities I needed, without a whole lot of extra bells and whistles  and at an affordable price. TimeFox helps me understand my business better, lets me reply instantly and honestly to client questions  and makes billing a cinch.  Oh. And the customer service is really good too. Whenever Ive had a question (no matter how dopey) I was able to talk to someone with the knowledge and patience to walk me through the solution. "

We haven't looked back since.We use the software for a range of functions, including the usual project management features but also for things like keeping the team informed on whats happening across the business.  The only real draw back (and its unlikely to effect most users) is the lack of interdependencies on tasks.  "

What the hell?I was also told that it is APPFOLIO'S practice to release new APPLICATION before they are fully developed to get customer feedback first so that their new idea can be refined.  Well that sounds progressive and smart but NOT when using their ""incomplete application"" will result in being cited by the Department of Licensing!Go figure!I wish I had the phone number or someone high up in that organization... surely they are unaware of what I am describing.  Anyone have a phone number for me?"
AppFolio,www.appfolio.com,John Smith,"Friday, May 16, 2014","I have been using Appfolio for the past six months.  Overall, I am satisfied with the software, but maybe it's because our company just transferred over from Yardi Genesis (very old school).  One of the main issues I am having with Appfolio is there is no way to account for credit card purchases.  When expenditures are made, the only account available to be offset is a cash account.  Proper accounting is to offset the debit in the expense account with a credit in a liability account (such as a credit card payable account).  Basic accounting , but Appfolio still cannot perform this function.  What does this say about a company, that prides itself for being an accounting software, when it still cannot perform this basic function?  It has been a real set back due to the regular use of credit cards in our daily operations. "
Palace,www.getpalace.com,Mike Seagar,"Friday, October 24, 2014","Active Property Management and its precursor Wellington Property Management have been using Palace or its predecessor RealBase since the early 1990s.  We have experienced other property management software, mainly through experience and association with other property management entities and there is no doubt that Palace is the best system available.  However the system is not just the sole reason we can highly recommend Palace - the company ownership and management, and as a consequence it's personnel and client relationship style is very much family oriented.Perhaps most important of all is that Palace people listen to their clients, they are always very understanding and helpful, and prepared to take on board suggestions for upgrade changes that make our property management lives so much easier.Great system, great people, what more could you want!"

I was able to be productive with very little training,  The way ResMan address our workflows overall reflects what we see on a daily basis in our positions. I came from another software where I had to log into multiple models to retrieve the weekly  data I needed to manually generate  my weekly reports.   ResMan has the majority of the information I need in the main boardroom that can be exported to a PDF for sharing with our executive team via email.   We recently started using the texting feature that is hands down my favorite ad on.  We can not only text out of the software, responses from residents are automatically stored in our communication logs.    Our property managers love this feature because of the improved communication with residents.   As a regional I love the fact that the communication is captured in the communication logs without relying on a leasing agent to log the interaction.  ""Greatness""I would like to see some cosmetic enhancements to the resident portal.  The portal is very easy for the residents; however, I would like to can have something more customized to the look and feel of our website. "

I like that tenants can submit custom offers, thus you can be sure that property will be rented at fair market price. What I like about this platform that it does tenant screening. They use Experian for this purpose. I run credit reports and background checks through this service before.  Tenants  love Rentberry as well, because they dont pay application fees whereas others sites charge extra money for apply. I also like that the site syndicates listing to other platforms, as a result  more tenants are getting engaged.

Clients often give me a great feedback about how beautiful my proposals are. The photos and videos splash, how I can change the color of theme (and I always change to the colors of that client when it's a big one), etc. I heard once: ""Well, if your proposal it's like this, I'm sure your work is great too, because you had the time and effort to make even this part of the process pleasant.Qwilr is easy, beautiful and the guys are really helpful, every time I had a question they were fast on the response.Also the latest update with a lot of new integrations made the service even better.I highly recommend."

Our external documents now look beautiful, and we've been able to increase the success rate of our new business proposals. Qwilr pages work brilliantly on any device so we know the recipient will enjoy the experience of opening and reading them. The feedback we've had from clients is overwhelmingly positive, and this app has helped us increase our new business win rate. Qwilr pages have just the right amount of customisation. We can make the Qwilr pages look and feel like ""us"", but we can't go so far as to break the great design inherent in a Qwilr page. The analytics and data behind it is great too  we have a lot more knowledge about the effectiveness of our documents now. We love it and will keep using Qwilr to grow our business."

Ipressroom,www.ipressroom.com,Beth,"Thursday, January 10, 2013","As our business has grown, we wanted to try and outsource some of our digital marketing. Initially were looking at brick and mortar PR firms. A friend who runs their own business mentioned Ipressroom. We decided to give them a trial go because the pricing was so much more favorable. I can honestly say they exceeded our expectations. I thought we'd get minimal effort, baseline marketing, but they really stepped up to the plate. Everything is digitized and automated, which was great for me, as I'm not incredibly social-network savvy.  They were able to take our updates and correlating blog and website posts and output them into several different places to maximize our exposure. We have had several new clients over the last month. That kind of increase in so short a span of time has to be the result of their campaigning methods. They aren't a full service PR firm. But for us this was perfect, as we felt something full service really wasn't what we needed. Ipressroom was that middle ground for us. You have full control and can do things your way.

When I came into my company we were already using Meltwater to find reviews and press stories about my company which were then displayed on our website.In the beginning things worked well, but over time publications have begun to lock away their news stories, requiring logins to view the information.  As a result, we were left with a very expensive service that was rendering links to information our customers could not view.When it came time to renew our contract we tried to cancel.  The problem is that 60 days prior to the end of a contract you must submit in writing that you plan to cancel.  Well 58 days prior to the end of the contract Nick, the Sales Manager in the DC offices, was still explaining our options to us, and failed to mention to cancellation policy deadline.  When I pointed out his failing Nick simply said that normally he is on top of these things, but our deadline just slipped through the cracks because he was busy setting up his new office, and he was happy this had happened because it gave him a chance to show us what he could do for our company.We are currently in discussions with the main office to cancel our contract, but so far Meltwater is holding firm about the deadline.  If Meltwater truly forces issue we are going to be left with THOUSANDS of dollars out a pocket for a service we do not want or that has any use to us."

I worked for Klopotek some 10 years ago and was at the time very impressed by the quality, depth and suitability of their software for publishing companies. Publishing has its own unique software needs to support specific processes such as Contracts, Rights and Royalties and subscription processing. In my view Klopotek offers by far the best software for managing all aspects of the publishing value chain with outstanding success in implementation and by far the lowest cost of ownership."

ComplianceQuest,www.compliancequest.com,Lee Theong,"Thursday, November 26, 2015","As the Director of Quality for a diagnostic company, I was entrusted with the responsibility of finding a QMS platform for our ISO and Healthcare compliance. Between IT and Quality, we unanimously selected CQ platform. After evaluating close to 10 different applications extensively, we chose CQ Platform for our QMS requirements.CQ did not let us down. The power behind the application and our success is the following: 1. Configuration to our liking: The application can be tailored to make a process as simple or as complex as we wanted. This ability allowed us to make the application work for a specific process in the way that our process owners needed. 2. Social Collaboration: The application's unique feature of social collaboration was simply amazing. We have not seen this capability with any other QMS vendor. The Social Collaboration feature allowed us to set-up collaboration channels across locations, departments and product lines. We can now ask an expert from another location for advice or assign a task as part of a process rather than relying on out dated communication models. Our CAPA or Change process quality has improved dramatically. Before CQ, the sharing or collaboration of information across locations was almost non-existent. 3. Reporting: Clearly the best out there. CQ has a very good reporting platform. Creation of reports is easy and elegant. The report scheduling feature has saved us a lot of time running and delivering reports to managers a breeze. I have used some of the established QMS applications in the past. Usually, we have to revert to Crystal Reports or invest in expensive reporting tools after the QMS platform was deployed. The cost savings with this alone was more than what we paid for the CQ platform. 4. Customer Service: CQ's attitude of customer comes first rings true in every aspect of their dealings with us. They are there regardless of what the issues were and worked with us to address them promptly.I am now a big believer in CQ platform. I will root for their success as it has been a long time since I found a company with not only a strong product but very good customer service."
ComplianceQuest,www.compliancequest.com,Natalie Kimball,"Thursday, November 26, 2015","We have been using ComplianceQuest application QMS platform for sometime now. Application is impressive. Works as shown. It is easy to configure, manage and use.We use their Document Control, Training, CAPA, Audit and Equipment Management solutions. Our users (management, mid level and customer facing personnel) have embraced the application well. The roll-out was smooth and went as planned.We went from a manual system to automated system. They had cautioned us to take it slow and ensure that the adoption for the first couple of processes were solid before going live with the rest of the processes. Their advise was spot on.One thing that stands out about ComplianceQuest is that their customer service is excellent. They are there for you all the way.  I wish all of our applications worked and was supported as well as ComplianceQuest!"
ComplianceQuest,www.compliancequest.com,Jason Miller,"Monday, November 23, 2015"," We recently began using ComplianceQuest system for Document Control and Training Management requirements.  My company uses the application for other processes as well. But since my job function is focused on managing the document control and training functions, my review is limited to this.The software is easy to use. With little to no training, I was able to team learn what we needed to do and also develop training materials for the company employees to learn. We went from a paper based system to an automated system in less than a week. The application is fast and ensures that we enter valid information which makes reporting a lot easier.The reporting function within compliancequest application is amazing. It is so easy to create new reports. Reports that my management want now can be produced in a few minutes. If needed, I can even export them to excel and format them to my liking.The controlled document module works elegantly. The search feature finds the docs fast. The library feature allows for documents to be grouped logically. The document training matrix that the system constructs removes a large part of our training headache. The document approval process is easy to configure either by a policy definition or using the ad-hoc approval assignment. My management likes the ability to review and approve using their mobile or tablet device. Also, any outstanding training that is past due is now easily visible and I can take the relevant action.I love the Social Collaboration feature within the software which allows the employees to chat with me or with the relevant authors to ask questions in either real-time or through posts about documents. This Social Collaboration capability alone has helped me and my organization to speed the document release process as the knowledge imparted to one employee is visible to others."
ComplianceQuest,www.compliancequest.com,Nalini Deshpande,"Friday, February 6, 2015","We chose ComplianceQuest to address our ISO 9000 compliance and Continuous Improvement needs.  Our criteria was that the software should be cloud based, address the ISO 9000 requirements well, easy to implement, accessible from anywhere and also from any device.  I must say that after looking at over 20 different QMS platforms, CQ provided the best value for money.  CQ is the only platform in the market place that has a strong mobile strategy and this allows our field sales, services teams to be connected to our QMS initiative with little to no effort. We chose to implement CQs Nonconformance Management, CAPA Management, Document Management and Related Training, Audit and Supplier Management.  My management was truly impressed with the speed at which we got the implementation finished and also how easy it was to use the solution.  I have used competing platforms in the past, CQ has been by-far the easiest and cheapest in the market place.    Customer service is by far the best.  They are there for me.  To be honest, I have not had any technical support issues, but they were eager to help me through the implementation and the nice thing is that they never nickelled and dimed me when it came to implementation cost. Thanks to my boss for introducing me to this company.  I started being a doubter and CQ staff has made me a believer out of them."
ComplianceQuest,www.compliancequest.com,Shawn Reyes,"Tuesday, February 3, 2015"," We looked at a number of solutions for our needs including some of the so called been in the market for a long time and prominent solutions before selecting ComplianceQuest (CQ) platform for our QMS needs. We have on our staff who have used other QMS solutions from the past and they keep saying to me that CQ platform, is hands down, the most advanced in the market and also very simple to use. ComplianceQuest uses the SalesForce technology and thus our deployment on the cloud was quick and we were live with our process configuration in a few weeks from signing up for the service.When we signed up, we were concerned as to how much we need to know SalesForce.com platform. We realized quickly, we did not need to know anything about SalesForce platform and it was one of the easiest platform to learn. Very intuitive. CQ applications also have cleverly leveraged the SalesForce platform's Social capabilities through out the solution to make collaboration between us and our supply chain partners a breeze.The CQ team has been amazing to work with. They were there for us night and day. We have operations in several countries and we were supported by their US and off-shore team and we could not have been happier with their service levels."

Atlatl Software,www.atlatlsoftware.com,Neil Turner,"Friday, February 12, 2016","Atlatl Software continues to list our company as a customer reference in their marketing materials. They do this despite knowing that we are completely unsatisfied with our experience. In the almost 3 years poured into getting a working configurator, we only had a sort of working version for a couple of months (almost two years later than promised).  While attempting to fix the bugs in the initial version, they broke code that caused major errors. Wrong parts would be added to the quote, key parts would be missing, discounts would be applied wrong - heck, it even had problems with basic math! By this point we had invested countless hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars into a project that optimistically generated less than a dozen quotes for us and none of them faster than our top people could generate the ""old"" way. In an effort to salvage some value our of the project, Atlatl agreed to provide us with a stripped down version of the configurator - one that would not compile quotes or save information, just one that we could build scenes to use as an educational tool. That version worked just fine, but the way they distributed it to us had a built in expiration of 90 days. That's right - after 90 days it just stopped working! In trying to get it fixed, the developers knew what they had done was not right, but the company owner blocked them from correcting the problem. I explained the situation to the owner in writing and over the phone. Our phone conversation was cut short when he said ""[Expletive] you, buddy"" and hung up on me. Now if that is how they treat the customer they chose to highlight at the top of their customer list on their website (as we are still listed at time I am writing this), how do you expect to be treated by them? Be wary."

TrackerRMS,www.tracker-ats.com,Shelby Spencer,"Wednesday, May 1, 2013","As an executive formerly responsible for a very large scale deployment of another system, I am extremely familiar with all the risks, rewards, capabilities, and limitations of CRM software. Upon joining OHS it was immediately clear that we had outgrown the configuration of our implementation and needed to pursue a common operating platform that our various service lines and business teams could collectively use to manage their activities, but without breaking the bank! To identify the right partner for our organization, we elected to undertake an extremely robust market level analysis. Our goal was to find a product that afforded us a high degree flexibility while maintaining ease of use and ease of administration. And provided comprehensive functionality with an affordable and fixed total cost of ownership. We evaluated 60 different products in total - TrackerRMS was the hands down winner. TrackerRMS offers an extremely intuitive, clean, and easy to use design and navigation. Included in the base product are functionality and features that you almost always have to purchase separately or pay more for elsewhere. And the TrackerRMS customer service support is quite frankly among the best I've seen. I would strongly recommend TrackerRMS in both my capacity as a current user, and a long time IT executive and buyer of software systems."

Thanks to Tracker we are now able to respond automatically to leads from our website, follow up with template emails, send campaign emails and manage projects and reporting all from one easy to use system.

A software company which listens to its clients  what refreshing change! Needless to say, we cannot recommend TrackerRMS strongly enough. "
TrackerRMS,www.tracker-ats.com,Karen Pawlowska,"Thursday, April 25, 2013","We started using TrackerRMS over two years ago having looked at several other options. We hadn't previously had an official CRM system, but did have carefully constructed spreadsheets which were stored locally on our server. We chose TrackerRMS because it was really easy to use, the support we got from the technical support team was exceptionally good during our trial sessions and it had great functionality.  Having decided to buy, the implementation was good - there a few oddities but they were in the main at our end and the Tracker RMS team were brilliant at helping us get things sorted, as well as very patient. The benefit of having the TrackerRMS system was brought sharply home when later in the first year of use, a senior member of our marketing team was off ill for several months. Previous to having TrackerRMS we would of struggled to keep on top of required sales leads and follow-ups, but having the system meant someone was able to pick up from our usual representative seamlessly. Moving forward, the system has proved very valuable for tracking the life cycle of projects and for targeting new areas for possible business. The functionality is really good and we have recommended the system to a number of our contacts."
TrackerRMS,www.tracker-ats.com,Mark Gidge,"Thursday, April 25, 2013",Having undergone full tendering processes for three separate companies which I chaired. The TrackerRMS system was adopted in each case despite the businesses having little in common in terms of size and market sector. TrackerRMS is a flexible and comprehensive CRM tool which provides flexibility in the areas needed for user configuration. Easy to use and without the usual clunkiness of some of the better known brands. The system has enabled us to launch marketing and sales campaigns without the need for specialist support or large IT infrastructures.
TrackerRMS,www.tracker-ats.com,Mark Protheroe,"Thursday, April 25, 2013","TrackerRMS was selected after a review of other potential products. We selected TrackerRMS due to the greater flexibility of the solution and the responsiveness of the support team. TrackerRMS replaced an in-house solution that had been developed over 8 years. Initially we had concerns that a package solution would not provide the same service, but after a trial of the product our concerns were ameliorated.  TrackerRMS provides as much flexibility as the old solution and many more features that are really enhancing our business and the way we engage with clients. We installed Sales TrackerRMS for use by our sales team and management. The benefits were realised within the first month: Opportunities are now managed centrally with access from any location. Sales personnel can see targets and which opportunities need to close to meet them. Managers have a centralised view of opportunities developed with common metrics. This makes sales comparisons and forecasting more of a science than the previous guess work.  Management reporting is real benefit and has helped increase profitability by freeing up people to sell rather than internal paperwork. Marketing and Campaigns are now all done through TrackerRMS. This was a benefit that we did not know we needed until it arrived; now we cannot see how we worked effectively without it. We now run at least two campaigns a month and can see the results adding to the bottom line. TrackerRMS allows us to target clients through defined campaign metrics, hone in on those that have shown an interest and then convert them into leads and opportunities. Outlook Integration is a real bonus and allows email communications (in and out) to be managed through TrackerRMS at the click of a button.  This means that communications with a client can be seen by all staff supporting that client and management. The email audit can be seen per client or per opportunity allowing a full picture of the client and how we have communicated with them. Good emails can be seen from the response they get, TrackerRMS allows us to learn from our colleagues and copy best practice. The TrackerRMS Support Team has helped all the way, been responsive and helped with a regular webinar specifically for our company. Data transfer was our major concern and how this was going to be achieved. The TrackerRMS team made sure that all data was transferred correctly before we started using the solution. Any issues with the system or mostly user error are handled efficiently, usually within hours. The TrackerRMS support team is one good reason to consider this product and undertake a trial. The benefits we have from using TrackerRMS are clearly being seen in terms of increased sales and hence increased profitability of the company. We have therefore increased our licences by 50%. Sales and profit increase have been achieved through a product that allows us to see what is working and concentrate on that. Campaign information allows us to tailor what we do. Through running the campaigns we are seeing more client interest and more enquiries for additional services. It is early days with this, but I would estimate that the use of TrackerRMS has provided a 30% increase in sales and conversions. "
TrackerRMS,www.tracker-ats.com,Sam,"Tuesday, April 9, 2013","Having carried out an exhaustive assessment of CRM systems based in the UK (of which there are a lot!), we eventually selected TrackerRMS as our system of choice.

We've been impressed with the team at TrackerRMS and recommend them to others."

TalentBin,www.talentbin.com,Ashley ,"Wednesday, February 25, 2015","This is the worst application on the market, and a total waste of money. The email addresses are wrong 30% of the time, at least, so you are thinking that you have sent something to someone and you get reply from someone totally different (I have had replies from 13 year old kids, people in foreign countries or completely different industries,  etc.).  Furthermore, the app is impossible to use and nearly ALWAYS has incorrect information, so it's a waste of time. For instance, you go through the search and find half of people that are outside the country or city you are searching in, most are doing something different than what you chose (but are 'interested' in what you chose, which is not helpful for a recruiter).  I paid 6K for an app that I don't use.

Chargebee,www.chargebee.com/,Leon Muller,"Thursday, January 3, 2013","I first heard of ChargeBee after doing some trial integration of similar companies with our new SaaS app. A quick look over their API documentation and we were off to work integrating their system with our billing and customer management. ChargeBee's API was very easy to integrate, it took only 1 day to get up and running on their sandbox due to their great example code. As an Australian startup it's very difficult to find a payment manager that can connect to a payment gateway to process USD. Fortunately ChargeBee integrates with both Worldpay and eWay. We use Worldpay as our payment gateway so it was paramount that our payment manager supported them. Not only do they support them but about 25 other payment gateways should we ever need to change payment gateways. ChargeBee's fees are cheap which makes it a great option for startups who are bootstrapping their building. Their pricing is very competitive and was the best I could find on the market. The team at ChargeBee are very helpful and always respond quickly to support emails. Any questions we've had have been answered in detail and the team is a pleasure to communicate with. I will be using and recommending the ChargeBee billing platform for all my future projects."
Chargebee,www.chargebee.com/,Sebastien Powell,"Thursday, January 3, 2013","I discovered ChargeBee several months ago whilst searching for a subscription billing service for my company. After trialing several solutions, we decided to settle with ChargeBee and haven't looked back since. Not only is ChargeBee's pricing structure far more competitive than other providers, they also have some fantastic features planned for release in the coming months. Including integration with a variety of third-party services. But what I like the most about ChargeBee is the friendliness and responsiveness of the team. They are extremely attentive to your needs, fixing errors and rolling out feature requests at incredible speed. In fact, I have no hesitation in saying that their customer support is the best I've ever seen. I would highly recommend ChargeBee to anyone looking for the best subscription billing platform available. "

eBLVD.com,www.eblvd.com ,Dan Frantz,"Wednesday, October 30, 2013","I don't use their remote meeting portion, just the remote desktop for tech support/troubleshooting.  We've had it for nearly 4 years now and for the most part, the service has been really good.  There's only been a few outages that were of notable length so they have been fairly reliable. However, there's 2 really big problems with the software.  #1 - when remoting to a computer in the same network, transfer speeds (especially for files) are usually abysmally slow.  I'm not sure why this is but 9/10 times, I will get horrible file transfer rates.  Doesn't matter if its wireless or wired.  There's still a significant delay in doing things on the screen when there shouldn't be.  #2 They don't have an RnD department.  Don't expect them to support the newest versions of browsers and operating systems.  As of the writing of this review, they do not support Windows 8.1 and it was available to the public for months.  There's absolutely no excuse as to why.  I emailed support and was told they don't support Win8.1 yet and it would be at least 3 weeks before they do support it.  Really not excusable, in my opinion. I would only recommend this software to someone that is only using it for Remote Desktop in an environment that is static and not prone to changes.  Updates to anything new will often result in frustrating experiences."

""Stop if you do not want BE suspended forever"" What? I can not believe this answer. My site is back, three or four days later, but i can't connect to my FTP, they changed my passwords, several weeks later, I still did not have ftp access. they don't want give me a passwords. I was already on another hosting."
iVhosting,ivhosting.com,Andre,"Monday, June 23, 2014","FLEE! BEFORE ALL LOSE. They are not professionals. I was more than 6 years to stay in this place. I had a service of the lowest floor. The connection is ok, as everywhere. The cheap prices. If your site is worthless and you have ready to lose everything, go-one! But it was the service that goes with it. They never contact for maintenance, they suspended my account without warning several times. I had more sites, no e-mails for several days without knowing why. So good for a business. Customer Service arrogate, it are not gentlemans. That meet after several days. You deserve better. I do not understand how I stay there so long time, it is torture. I'm really angry against them, it is not possible a bad service."
iVhosting,ivhosting.com,fd,"Friday, June 20, 2014","Want you feel loser? I was several years customer home. I often wondered if I was the only customer of a boy in his basement. Have you seen the site http://ivhosting.com/ for months or years half of the links on the site not working me, it is abandoned. There are currently no active phone number, no fixed address. The service meets the customer when they want, there is no service 24 on 24h, 7 days on 7, or it mocks answer. We never notify us maintenances, it cuts. It does not feel important in them. It is not normal to be treated like that. If you are dissatisfied like me, tell this business does not deserve to exist."
Sureshot Hosting,www.sureshothosting.net,Robert,"Tuesday, February 5, 2013","We were using SureShot Hosting for a personal website for many years so it was the obvious choice when we started our business site.

3iX Networks,www.3ix.org,Salavika,"Wednesday, November 26, 2014",They are scammers. Very poor services. Staff is extremely rude and always takes too much time for a single question to answer. Very bad and poor hosting I ever used. I will never recommend them to anyone.
3iX Networks,www.3ix.org,Yaldaram,"Tuesday, October 14, 2014","3ix.org is one of the worst hosting provider I have ever came across with. Extremely poor services, no support for 'Excite Plan' clients, they provide support only for the plans above. Also your site will be shutdown if you are getting any DDOS attack or is using some bandwidth resources without prior notification. They even do not give you the refund, so please stay away from this bad hosting provider.Thanks, Yaldaram"
Cyber Ultra Network,www.cyberultra.net,W Faris,"Tuesday, January 31, 2012","CyberUltra is a very good and affordable company, services are excellent, problems are fewer than all other 5 companies i tried previously, all software, Cpanel, PHP MyAdmin etc. are all up to date.

emerion,www.emerion.com/,Isabella Mayer,"Thursday, October 24, 2013",Only can suggest this web hosting company. Being their customer for almost 3 years and I always was able to choose whatever package I needed at time. Especially their customer support makes it an easy to choose them. Very nice and helpful ppl! :)
emerion,www.emerion.com/,David,"Thursday, October 24, 2013","I've been using their cloud services for the past few months now and received fast and friendly support whenever I needed. They are also very forthcoming with individual requirements when a product plan doesn't fit 100%. The pricing model and the cloud also allows my services to grow or shrink with the demand, which is just what is was looking for."
Genuian,genuian.com,Samuel Collins,"Wednesday, August 28, 2013","Horrible customer service.  Unexplained account and password lockout issues.  Turn around time on tickets vary; more often than not an ""ok"" turn around time but very bad customer service."
Genuian,genuian.com,Greg P,"Monday, April 2, 2012",No phone contact or support.  Multiple layers of passwords required for different account access with no coherent explanation.  Turnaround time for tickets submitted totally unpredictable.  Help pages void and unsupported.
Hosting24,www.hosting24.com,Ramon,"Monday, December 30, 2013","This server is not OK, every month appears a new problem."
Hosting24,www.hosting24.com,Andrew S.,"Tuesday, November 6, 2012",I have been hosting with them for a while now (almost 2 years). They have honest and professional support that helps out every time I contact them. Servers are working OK and I never noticed any downtime. I guess what separates them from the others is their great price and as I said before very nice support.
HostSEO,www.hostseo.org,Richard,"Sunday, March 1, 2015","I'm part of the hostgator/seohosting.com exodus. Since they got bought out, the service and support has gone down the crapper. HostSEO has been a god send. I use them for both EU & US SEO Hosting and love being able to manage my sites, that span different countries, from a single web host. I've only needed help once, but the time I needed it, they responded within a few minutes."
HostSEO,www.hostseo.org,Thomas White,"Friday, February 6, 2015","I use various SEO Host's for my SEO strategy and these guys are by far the best. I've used them for several years and have never had any issues. Their support is on-point and I've often received assistance from their top executives. I never hesitate to recommend these guys, my only worry is that the quality will go down if too many people find out about them, but that hasn't been the case to date."
MyIdealHost,myidealhost.com,Andy,"Thursday, September 13, 2012",I hosted my website at a different hosting provider before MyIdealHost. Unfortunately the site became inaccessible from time to time and their support couldn't identify and fix the problem. I couldn't identify and solve it either because I am just a regular internet user. I suppose it could be some routing problem because I am from Russia. Anyway I decided to migrate the website to another hosting provider. I tried a few companies but wasn't totally satisfied until I moved the website to MyIdealHost. It looks like MyIdealHost isn't a big hosting provider and care about every client because their support is really fast and friendly. I am totally satisfied by MyIdealHost. 
MyIdealHost,myidealhost.com,Vinnie,"Thursday, November 24, 2011","I've been using MyIdealHost.com for about a year now to host several sites including one reseller account for a new venture, and I must say I have been very impressed by their service and support. The server has had very stable uptime, the features included in the hosting accounts are very powerful considering the cost, but most impressive has been their support. In particular, the response time for support requests has been very quick, especially considering that most companies don't even respond to support requests in the same day any more."
VodaHost,www.vodahost.com,Vicky Shaw,"Tuesday, April 19, 2016","We have used this company for 6 years to host our website and emails.  Have had the occasional problem, which have generally been resolved , but customer service always extremely poor.  However, now our website has been down for almost a week with emails rarely working.  Apparently they have a server issue.  We have submitted 'ticket after ticket' with promises that it has been or will be resolved.  Still not sorted, we are losing business on a daily basis and it is impossible to speak with anyone in person on the telephone.  Great company - unless there is a problem.  We are now faced with having to transfer to another website host urgently as they don't seem to have the expertise to back up the promises they make."
VodaHost,www.vodahost.com,Jason Scoutari,"Monday, April 22, 2013",I am very happy with this hosting provider as all my websites run excellent and without any problems. I always have great support in building and hosting my websites with them. I highly recommend them to everyone.
"WebCitz, LLC",www.webcitz.com,Jeff,"Tuesday, April 10, 2012","WebCitz has delivered the sports-related equivalent of the twelfth-man for our business! In football, the advantage of the hometown stadium and fans are sometimes referred to as the twelfth-man. WebCitz is our twelfth-man.

"WebCitz, LLC",www.webcitz.com,Dan,"Monday, January 2, 2012",Our company utilized WebCitz to completely redo our web presence. As we got into the process we were continually surprised by the can do attitude of David and his team. He had the ability to demystify the process and functionality so we could easily understand what was possible. We will continue to recommend WebCitz.
Ample Hostings,www.amplehosting.co.za,Advancecoach,"Wednesday, September 21, 2016","TERRIBLE SERVICE. I want someone to talk me through my problem not do it by e mail.  Problem took 57 e mails, X3 Technicians  and 10 days to solve. They REFUSE TO GIVE A NUMBER WHERE YOU CAN PHONE THEM OR TO PHONE YOU. Email instructions from them very vaque and incomplete and Technicians even pass on  basic mistakes about upper /lowercase which then boms one out again.    It is all about their own cheapskate requirements and not what the customer want . Even a request to the owner to call me  to discuss my  frustrations is ignored. Still waiting for the call. My Recommendation STAY AWAY!!!I placed a previous comment here and did not even want to give  them a rating,  but I see the  system took it as 5 star which is definitely not my rating."
CheapResellerHost,www.cheapresellerhost.com,David,"Friday, November 21, 2014",Why I say CheapResellerHost.com is the best reseller hosting because their support is really good and kind. Support is 24x7 and they are very helpful. The support staff really knows that a Reseller client's business is totally dependant on them and they really care for their clients and their reseller business.

Funio,www.funio.com,Andre Boies,"Monday, December 21, 2015","Hosting was terrible. They had no clue regarding transferring databases and saving it.

Initially I have consulted sales staff to define with suitable plan and features. Setup have been performed in almost an instant right after the payment. I haven't had a single hardware failure with a server. It has been running just fine and smooth.Tech support is really great! I have always got a response within a several minutes.Page load times are very fast and networking is working in high stable manner.By far the worst issue was not their fault, I got an automated IP block and my e-mails haven't delivered, I solved this trouble using google apps.So, basing on the price of my plan and service I am receiving overall positive experience and hope they will keep this level further."
HostNine,www.hostnine.com,Jonathon Lucas,"Thursday, September 8, 2016",Worst hosting provider ever! I have around 10-20 unanswered tickets spanning back 3 months.  They remove features from their servers such as website builders that were part of my package and suddenly my websites don't work because the site builder is no longer installed.They migrated a lot of my sites to new servers but many sites were not transferred properly or days after the transfer and past the expected transfer completion date sites were still offline.Last year they lost a large number of my clients websites because there servers failed and had no backups. They still say all websites are backed up on their website but can you really trust it when it comes to it.Also I am pretty sure they had many reviews here on Serchen but now I will be the first to review them. This is very odd and I wonder if all the bad reviews were getting to them!Do yourself a favor and use a company that can actually do what they say they can do. 
HostRanger,www.hostranger.net/,tom,"Friday, March 15, 2013",Worst support ever! They never respond to any requests and they have some serious server issues. 
HostSo,www.hostso.com,Domz Anacion,"Monday, February 18, 2013","Hostso was great a few years ago. Last year I recommended Hostso to a client  whose site I was developing because it was the most affordable host for a local small business. Unfortunately there was a lot of downtime each month in mid 2012, usually because of SMART errors of the drives. My client lost a lot of potential online customers. Hostso issued a refund (lesser amount) to my client, and what made it worse is he lost more money because a lot of customers of his website demanded refunds from him as well due to Hostso's unreliable service. Stay away from this host, look for a more reliable webhost. It's worth spending extra bucks for a more stable service. If you're already with them, good luck! Make a daily backup of your site elsewhere so you can easily transfer. "
Hudson Valley Host,www.hudsonvalleyhost.com,Jonathan Stevens,"Thursday, June 14, 2012","I am not easily impressed, and nor do I make reviews often, but HVH are beyond belief, they are one of the best if not the best hosting company actually forget hosting company but company I have ever dealt with.

The staff are arrogant and incompetent and know nothing about CPanel or WHM and would steal your CPanel password to upload phishing scam software and then blame you and ask you to pay for it to be cleaned. The most nasty experience i have ever had. They are thieves. The worst hosting company in the UK.

As a result, our team is actively using integration with tfs. The system is very convenient to maintain and control a list of risks.

Sofon ,www.sofon.com,Jeffrey Key,"Tuesday, October 22, 2013","We have been using Sofon to configure our products and after looking at the data, Sofon has been an extremely invaluable tool in streamlining the entire order process.  We have been able to up our order facilitating by twenty-five percent in the four months we have been using Sofon. This is amazing!"
Sofon ,www.sofon.com,Jan Kreiter,"Thursday, August 15, 2013","WTH is the market leader in floor and wall systems for heating and cooling, for both new construction and renovation. During the past few years, the market has changed dramatically. We still receive many requests for quotations but scoring rates have gone down. Customers ask multiple suppliers for quotations more frequently. So it is critical to come up with a solid, error-free, and uniformed quotation as fast as we can. With Sofon, we have made enormous progress in terms of our error percentage, speed and uniformity in the sales process. We were also able to shorten the training period for new sales staff. Sofon presents us with the right questions, explanations, and all possible answers; the system actually educates our users while generating calculations and quotations. A new staff member is therefore productive immediately. We get the added benefit of handling more work (3,250 unique quotations a year) with fewer people while we give customers better advice."
Sofon ,www.sofon.com,Erwin de Vrind,"Tuesday, July 9, 2013","Last minute requests to us are more and more often a day-to-day occurrence for us. So it was time for us to optimize the sales process.

What a project manager used to do in his head  making decisions, calculating  now takes place systematically under the hood of the Sofon engine. Our quotation cycle time has also been shortened (from 4 hours to just 2 to 3 minutes) and the insight into our pipeline has improved. For us, Sofon is a real strategic tool to achieve our commercial goals."

Each different section in a supermarket is dependent on what is already available or will become available in the supermarket. Sofon takes everything into account and even makes sure that we only sell profitable orders. In the past, errors could easily slip into quotations and into production. With Sofon, mistakes can no longer be made. Not even by new colleagues. They are productive within a few weeks. Previously, half a years training was necessary. "

As soon as the configuration is completed, bills of materials, routings and client-specific information for the laser marking machine (used for printing logos on the saws) are automatically handed over by Sofon to ERP. This prevents mistakes from happening. Sofon also saves us time because all relevant documents are updated automatically when a change has been made."

The productivity of our sales office is much higher, sales employees can generate correct quotations within minutes even while the customer is on the phone. This used to take days! Our fast quotation lead time makes a big difference in terms of sales. We have 15 to 20% more orders since we've started working with Sofon, so we get more work done in less time with fewer people and obtain more orders."
Sofon ,www.sofon.com,Jan Hoxe,"Friday, June 29, 2012","We wanted to speed up, improve and simplify the quotation process using Sofon. Two of our staff members immersed themselves in Sofon modeling. They only needed four days of support from a Sofon consultant. We now also manage any changes or maintenance to Sofon ourselves. Now that we work with Sofon, everyone speaks the same language and quotes are offered at the same prices. We can also process requests much faster. A quotation for a complete production line can be generated within the hour; this used to take at least half a day. Even then we wouldn't be completely sure the content was absolutely correct. Sofon helps us to prevent all kinds of errors."

With Sofon, we know that quotations are clear and error-free. Thats a big difference compared with our previous situation. Copying and pasting from an old quotation led to errors. Maintenance also was a big problem. Nowadays, when product information changes, we only need to make the change once and all relevant documents are up-to-date. As Design & Proposal Manager I also no longer have to check quotations of hundreds of pages in detail. Sofon provides me automatically with a management report by e-mail with all the deviations from the standard in a quotation. Im especially happy with this feature! It saves time and offers us the possibility to improve the standard continuously. "

Azurepath is unlike any other CRM I've ever used as it truly provides me with meaningful reports that allow me to accurately forecast and create projections 3-4 quarters out.I've been using the software for several months now and honestly can't think of anything that I don't like about this product. Their staff was extremely responsive to any and all questions I had at initial launch, and I've even received an unsolicited check-in from the Azurepath team to make sure that I was getting the expected value from the application.Do your research and only seriously consider companies that offer a 30 or 60-day trail. As a Sales Executive, I live and die by the accuracy and insight that I'm able to pull from my CRM.

I left 1 start only because I couldn't leave zero. "
Orderbot Software,www.orderbot.com,Leroy Johnson,"Wednesday, July 29, 2015","When we first found Orderbot, it seemed to good to be true. They took me through countless demos, and took a ton of time to answer all my questions and learn about our business. We relatively small business when compared to some other their other clients. From day one they treated us with a ton of respect, and were super helpful, providing advise way beyond anything we could have every imagined.While it took us longer than we initially anticipated to implement (by about two weeks). They never came back to us and charged more for the extra time, and even helped us correct some of our mistakes.We are very impressed with the team, and software has exceed out expectations. My favourite feature is Orderguides!"
Orderbot Software,www.orderbot.com,Phillip,"Monday, July 6, 2015","Much like review posted from Robert @ Magicforest, we too were sold on the jazzy features of Orderbot.  Having tested 6-8 various order management systems we chose to go with Orderbot based on their stated features and ability to go-live quickly.  Having been customers of Netsuite and done full implementations of much more advanced systems, Orderbot didn't appear to be complicated.   However!  What you don't know until you sign up :a) they start billing you for services monthly even when the system isn't working or configured.b) they tell you that you can do a self service implementation but nowhere in the system does the client have access to enter information to set their systems up.   You rely on sending information to Orderbot and some random person to call you or do a task that should be simple and available for the user / client to do.  c) they miss scheduled calls and deadlines.  Repeatedly.d) conference calls, when they DO happen are more like troubleshooting their beta software than actually getting any training or knowledge.   Every single call was nothing but pointing out errors, system problems or functions that didn't perform correctly .. very basic functions like calculating shipping.   e) there is no documentation.  When I say that... I mean none.   So your'e stuck relying again on someone to answer questions.   f)  even if you are incredibly technically savvy, you will have nothing but running into walls with settings you cannot alter, data you cannot import, etc etc.Bottom line - we wasted MONTHS and THOUSANDS of dollars on a system that never functioned.  NEVER.  It never went live, never was setup completely, etc.   So finally we had no choice but to fallback on a secondary choice, which we were able to implement in a matter of a week.Currently looking at our legal options with this  company who basically fraudulently billed our company for services that were never rendered.  In summary, this is the worst performing SaaS and company we've encountered in nearly two decades of being in business. .... and we've encountered A LOT!"
Orderbot Software,www.orderbot.com,Robert Leuchtner,"Wednesday, April 8, 2015","JUST SAY NO TO ORDERBOT.	   		      Sept, 2014After nine months of effort, I was sadly disappointed with Orderbot.  We were sold on all the 'jazzy' features of Orderbot but none of it ever materialized.  After I pulled the trigger and signed the contract (early DEC 2013), we had hoped that we would be up and running within their promise of 60 days. My domestic operations manager was assigned to the project, as were two of her office staff.  The person assigned to us by Orderbot, unfortunately turned out to be more of a hindrance than a facilitator.  Orderbot eventually fired him after five months into our project, but even after that, things still moved slowly.   Up to that point, we had been able to get our item, customer, and vendor lists imported into Orderbot, but only through the arduous task of scheduling conference calls with the Orderbot principals in Canada.At this point in late July 2014, I was frustrated.  After eight month, there had been no sales order entry, no invoicing, no inventory management, nor import of any historical sales data from our accounting system.   No data in Orderbot means no reports, no help in managing backorders, nor any of the other sales force features we wanted to improve our customer service and company efficiency.  Of course, we were on the hook for their $500/month service fee for the use of the software, not to mention the $5K (50%) down payment upfrontI run a small import/distribution company and my business is cyclical. Our busiest period of the year runs from late August to mid-December.  I gave Orderbot an ultimatum late in July that we needed to get moving and by the end of August because otherwise, my team would be fully occupied with their regular job.  Orderbot responded within 48 hours, and we seemed to be back on track.  I provided them with our historical sales data in the format that they requested.  It then took them a month to import this sales history.  We didn't hear from them again until it was almost done, no progress reports or anything.  When they did notify me that they were nearly finished, all I could think about was that the data was already a month out of date!  I fired them in September, a little more than nine months after we started.Here is a summary of the most critical problems and issues we encountered:1.	No manuals.  Are you kidding me? No easy on-line reference guides either?  The only possibility to train or re-learn Orderbot is to struggle through a series of on-line videos, none of which had good audio or with a native English speaker.  Yes, they really expect employees to sit through poor-quality reference videos each time they need a refresh on some operation in order to continue doing their job.2.	Integration with Quickbooks is a problem.  They claimed it was a no-brainer with third party soft-ware but it never happened.3.	Double-entry of data. We were not told in the beginning that, to get going required double entry of our sales information: once into Quickbooks, and the second into Orderbot.  The reason was that only after operating Orderbot over a 2-3 week period, could we see if it was working properly.4.	The accounting part, i.e. matching up Quickbooks accounts with Orderbot accounts, was held out till the end.  Ditto here on the 2-3 week double data entry to match the accounts up.  I am not a Harvard MBA, but I have post graduate degrees in math, physics, and chemistry. This isnt rocket science, and it shouldnt require a rocket scientist to implement.  I was instructed to hire a real accountant to make it all work properly.  There was no real guidance in this area from Orderbot, only that almost none of their customers integrate Orderbot with the accounting software.   Those that did gave up after a year or so because it was so damn difficult. Yes, this last statement was a real quote from the principal at Orderbot.  5.	They wanted the monthly subscription fee ($500 min/month) from the beginning, well before we were even close to running.6.	The user-interface is not intuitive.  There are no manuals. Navigating between different modules within Orderbot, knowing where to click to get drop down menus or launch some action was all very tenuous. I felt like it was guess work most of the time.  My team didnt have a good experience with it in the beginning either, however after a couple of months, they all got the hang of it.  But that makes me feel nervous.  If someone quit or was sick or on vacation, we would be stuck.  Real reference materials like manuals (either in print or on-line) are absolutely essential.  In summary, we spent a lot of time and money trying to make this work.  I encouraged my team every step of the way.  In the end, there was nothing about the implementation process that was straightforward.  There were problems, delays, and struggles at every step. Unfortunately, Orderbot  is not ready for prime time, and I cannot honestly recommend it to anyone.Dr. Robert Leuchtner"

Signpost,www.signpost.com,Lorenzo ,"Tuesday, September 13, 2016",Excellent followup on new prospects that helped us to increase our regular customer.
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Andrew Garner,"Tuesday, June 28, 2016",Many of the poor reviews seemed to think that this software was a magic bullet and would fix all of there marketing/customer acquisition problems. It won't. It isn't designed to be the only thing you need to do to get your name out there. You still need to hustle and do other marketing. This concept is great at remarketing to your customers and is a great CRM tool. I have used it to get over 35 referrals and 30 reviews on sites that effect my business and marketing efforts. It makes me pop when compared to the competition. If you understand what this does and understand how to use a CRM style tool then this product is invaluable in getting a business to the next level. 
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Dennis,"Monday, June 6, 2016","Signpost has been a great help to our business. When running a small business, it's hard to find enough time in the day to follow up with our customers. With Signpost's help, we're now seeing more reviews online, customers coming back more frequently, and they're even telling their friends about us."
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Elaine Sullivan,"Monday, February 22, 2016",Poor service for a small business.  No increase in customers from their service.  A lot of talk very little action.  They signed me up for another year without my authorization even after I had written and told them I wasn't continuing with them.  Don't do it!
Signpost,www.signpost.com,James Ravenscroft III,"Monday, February 22, 2016","I started a new business recently and don't have any customers. Signpost assured me that they were a marketing and advertising company that could help me generate new leads quickly and that there would be a team of people helping me succeed. After a month of nothing happening with my account I wrote them an email stating that I was sold a service, not software. I paid up front and am 4 months into a 6 month contract that was GUARANTEED 20 new leads a month and I have gotten 0 new leads from them. I told my account manager that I wanted a refund and she said that they were a Customer Relation Management service and not a marketing service. Why would I sign up for CRM when I don't have any customers? After telling her that the salesperson basically lied to me about what they are, her response was essentially ""well you're stuck with us for the next 2 months, let's make the most of it."""
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Vince DiLetto,"Tuesday, January 12, 2016","Waste of money. Didn't do anything. Auto renew, does not stand by guarantee of ""5 new people each month or money back"". What a mistake."
Signpost,www.signpost.com,John Modesto,"Monday, November 2, 2015","First their sales rep sells the software like it's the next big thing, but I only find bad reviews or reviews posted by them.  Next they claim to get your company positive feedback from your customers but they only have a few reviews for their company. Why is that? Why are they not encouraging their customers to write reviews if their software is ""the next big thing""? I know. It doesn't work and they do not want their customers to share their experience.In addition, why does anyone need a contract if their product works. Customers would not leave a service that's working for them. Seems ridiculous, because it is ridiculous."

Signpost,www.signpost.com,Natalie McCormack,"Tuesday, October 13, 2015","I want to start by saying I was weary at first.I am a co-owner of a company, Body Drop Fitness, and we signed up for a year contract about two months ago because we needed a way to get reviews. Signpost has already delivered more than what I expected! We received 12 Google  reviews in the first two weeks and are about to use the referral program as well. Now I haven't tried to cancel so I cant speak on how that process is but to be completely honest I don't see a need to cancel anytime in the near future. I cant speak for everyone, but it for sure worked for us. "
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Rachel,"Friday, October 9, 2015","Has honestly been very helpful for my business. Definitely not a hail-mary if you're in desperate need of customers but they delivered what they promised to me at least. I've never been good with computers or the internet, but at least with them I don't have to do much. We've noticed an increase in phone calls, and we've gotten a bunch of new reviews that my customers have been mentioning. I don't plan on cancelling so I can't comment on how easy that is, but for me the service has been great."
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Gina ,"Friday, October 9, 2015",Signpost has been great so far. I have been working with them for almost 6 months. My studio now finally has some great reviews on Yelp and I can communicate with my members through emails and texts easy.  The referrals have skyrocketed as well. I'm not sure why people have problems with the company because I can call my Account representative and change things and ask questions whenever I want and they always answer and explain things. It's definitely worth the price because I'm seeing tons of new referrals and a much stronger reputation on Yelp. 
Signpost,www.signpost.com,NATE,"Wednesday, September 16, 2015","I was told I could cancel within 30 days, they will not accept cancelation, have horrible reviews every for this same reason and poorly reviewed on BBB.  Now I keep getting the run around about my numerous cancellation requests"
Signpost,www.signpost.com,Kay,"Monday, April 13, 2015",I would never recommend Signpost to anyone. Act with caution if you get one of their sales calls.
Signpost,www.signpost.com,James Moore,"Wednesday, February 18, 2015","My company signed up for Signpost's services for one year.  This fall as the date of the expiration for their service approached (December 14) my office received emails reminding me that all I needed to do to cancel my subscription would be to ""phone or email 48 hours prior to the cancelation"".  Which I did.I even spoke with a representative - well in advance of 12/14 - about my desire to cancel.  Orion sent SEVERAL emails to Support stating our desire to cancel the subscription.Lo and behold - when I checked my AMEX account in January - Signpost had deducted two charges for $199 each.  I contacted AMEX and disputed the charges and AMEX - to their credit - removed them.Today - 2/17/15 - I received a message from AMEX that Signpost disputed my dispute claiming somewhere in the fine print of their contract with me I had not done ""enough"" to cancel my subscription.Clearly, their business ethics are suspect.  They send their customers notices indicating that the ONLY thing that needs to be done to cancel a subscription is to contact them by ""phone OR email"".  One of their employees in Support even emailed that she had received my Cancelation Request.However, apparently, Signpost has to admit that they will accept your request for it to be valid.  Such is the ethics of this company.  They intend to rebill AMEX.  AMEX feels compelled to pay it.  Due to unethical legalese. I have no intention of ever using this service again, and I intend to write unkindly about them whenever possible."
Signpost,www.signpost.com,All-Access Garage Doors,"Thursday, July 10, 2014","Anyone thinking of employing Sign Post for help advertising should beware. The sales representatives/customer service team ran me around in circles when I tried to cancel and terminate their services. Besides the fact that they completely failed to bring me any new clients (not bringing me even one new client a month), they offered inaccurate and contradictory information on the cancellation procedures. In May 2014, a month prior to the end of my 3 month agreement, I called their customer service department telling them I'd like to end all services at the end of the 3 months. A representative informed me that she could help me with this and that the service will be terminated at the end of the 3 month agreement. On June 8th, 2014, two days after my 3 month agreement ended, I noted a new charge of $375 on my credit card statement from Sign post. I called them immediately to inquire about this new charge and the representative this time informed me that I had been charged a new 3 month service fee. When I told her that I had called in May to cancel all services, she said she had no record of this transaction and that I am now responsible for the new charge."
SE Ranking,www.seranking.com,Steven,"Monday, September 8, 2014",I was looking for such kind of tool who manages my all queries in a single way. I found this best tool for searching ranking accurately for your project. The best part about this is Se Ranking made an additional effort to make all as comfortable as feasible with a few extra functions.

Could see what ad copies my competitors were running. Most importantly could see if the link building that was happening were actually a value add to my link profile.

Datadog,go.datadoghq.com/features,David G.,"Friday, August 1, 2014","DataDog is an important part of monitoring at SmarterAgent, where we use their API's and Integrations heavily, especially the CloudWatch integrations for Amazon's Web Services (AWS).  Using these, we have been able to put up effective dashboards for new environments in a matter of minutes.   We leverage DDs API primarily for eventing.  For example, deployments are posted to DataDog (as events), where they overlay our metrics.  This has proven very useful in tracking changes due to deploys and/or configuration changes. While we do leverage the DataDog agent for standard and custom metrics, DataDogs ability to put together dashboards (and alerting) for AWS without any modifications to the host is what really closed the deal for us.

Today I live chatted and there was no wait time either - hope they don't get worse over time but since they just added new features like newer and faster php, apache, mysql, and added a sitebuilder, without raising prices, that is good in my book. Last host I used kept jacking up price without even adding features in fact it was always slower. I switched to shovehost because of a good promo and I would not leave ever. Recommended!"

ShoveHost,www.shovehost.com/,Chris Cagle,"Monday, April 22, 2013","ShoveHost hosted our opensource project for about a year - albeit unreliably - but we stuck with them because they were also a member of the community and they seemed like they were trying to make things work. Until April 19th, 2013 when they shut our website down for no reason and with no warning because of something that they called a ""conflict of interest"". This conflict of interest caused us to be down for almost a whole day and with the help of 3 great volunteers finally got it back. Stay away from ShoveHost. The servers are unreliable and the owner cannot be trusted."

ShoveHost moved my sites over to my web hosting plan, made sure everything was working 100%, and also helped me set up my VPS. I am extremely impressed with the performance of the VPS - the performance is noticeably faster than my previous VPS host. It's amazing what a difference it is to host with a smaller company that actually cares about you and your online presence, unlike the big hosts that just want your money. ShoveHost also went above and beyond their obligations to help me set up Thunderbird with their ""ShoveMail"" Email Hosting system. Services I have with ShoveHost: Deluxe Web Hosting plan, ShoveMail Email Hosting (1 mailbox), and a Standard VPS. I'm definitely going to expand with ShoveHost and would not even think about switching. If my site grows enough I'll probably end up with a dedicated server which I'm sure would be as awesome as the other services. And I'll be transferring my domains to ShoveHost as well when they're up for renewal at my current registrar - I look forward to it! Something else worth mentioning is the Affiliate program that is available to all customers - 10% (recurring!) of all of ShoveHost's services. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, and once again, Thank You ShoveHost!"

There's not much more you can expect from a great hosting site like this one, and it is imperative that you try this site out if you're looking for some quality hosting. I was not deceived at all and neither will you be deceived. I greatly hope the owner of this company will have success with his hosting service, because he deserves it."
USHost247.com,www.ushost247.com,Andrew Lewis,"Monday, July 15, 2013","I renewed my hosting on March 29th. (I pay Semi-Annually) It should have said September but instead it said June. I mentioned about it to them at least twice and they said they would fix it but they never did. I waited for a few days and nothing changed or was fixed so I simply moved hosts. They found out and suspended me and banned my ip from the host completely. They planned to rip me off, and now, money is lost, no refund, no services, and still no explanation."

USHost247.com,www.ushost247.com,Allan,"Monday, February 25, 2013",I recently purchased a re-seller package from USHost247. I had a lot of questions to ask at first in which the staff there handled and answered all of them in a polite timely manner. They were able to transfer all my cpanels to their servers without any problems or downtime. The actual transferring went great. Since I have been on USHost247 my sites run a lot faster and smoother and I recommended them to anyone. The prices are good and support is excellent.

HOSTRIGS,www.hostrigs.com/,Arthur Richard,"Friday, July 18, 2014","I've been a Hosting Dens subscriber for the past 3 years and have had an excellent experience through them. When I first subscribed it was no matter of pricing, feature value, and the cPanel experience was best. Over the past three years Hosting Dens has resolved any issues I had with them. First with shared host and later with VPS. Until now everything was well, no downtime, no problems. I like their WHM panel and the customer's CPanel. Their support doesn't take long to answer, and they all are very cordial. Their price is very good too. But I think the true is you get what you pay for. I've been researching other solutions and every good provider charges 3 times more than Hosting Dens. Their support is a team of professionals, always have my websites up and running 24/7, also super quick at responding to our emails. The servers always are up. Hosting Dens is awesome..!!!"
HOSTRIGS,www.hostrigs.com/,Mark Henderson,"Monday, July 14, 2014",I had to migrate my site over from Crazy Domains (cos they turned to mush) and Hosting Dens were there to hold my hand the whole way even after midnight a couple of nights as we couldn't have the site down during normal working hours. I would like to say a really heartfelt thanks and gratitude for the help over the years. It's a pleasure working with the Hosting Dens team. These guys are great for hosting and they are really helpful with people who aren't good with computers. Best wishes - from the our team. 
HOSTRIGS,www.hostrigs.com/,Brain Doke,"Monday, April 7, 2014",We are truly satisfied with Hosting Dens. The last service provider we had was a bad experience for us and looking towards these people we found hosting dens is having a bright future. Cheers!!!
HOSTRIGS,www.hostrigs.com/,Brendon Schenecker,"Thursday, January 2, 2014","I am impressed by Hosting Dens. It has all of the features that I need for delivering my website. Before choosing this particular provider I researched various online forums and search thoroughly the web for reviews of all of the major providers. Hosting Dens came top of my short list of three. This is my first experience of a commercial web hosting provider. I was able to get from purchasing my domain name and web space to uploading a site all within the same day. When I have been uncertain of things I have found the support personnel to be patient and knowledgeable. This is coupled, very importantly, with their ability to explain what I see as complex technical concepts in easy to understand non-technical language. The net effect of this is that the personnel at Hosting Dens have the added value of being able to educate their users. As with all services there are minor things that could be adjusted but it would be surely to nit pick in a review like this. So suffice things to say I feel Hosting Dens has worked for me in terms of price, features and support. It is an excellent host and I really like the host like Hosting Dens ever!"

The fact that my site is being hosted by a Canadian company was also another reason for me to use Cirrus Tech."
Cirrus Hosting,www.cirrushosting.com,Danielle Fortin,"Monday, February 4, 2013","Our business has used Cirrus hosting for 1 year now. Their service to our office exceeds all of our expectations! Tech support is efficient, reliable, and they maintain a great level of efficient customer service! The staff I've dealt with directly have been very helpful, and have always remained professional. Any problems I have ever had with adding information to our site has been done efficiently. The gentleman I spoke to directly recently, were very polite and dealt with the issue at hand on a timely manner. For someone who isn't very computer savvy their tech support knows exactly what i'm talking about. Very impressive service!"
Cirrus Hosting,www.cirrushosting.com,Frank,"Thursday, January 31, 2013",I had Cirrus Hosting services for past 13 years and for all the time they have supported my personal website and my business server exactly as I expected. The price is great and at the same time the professionalism of their staff helped me not to have any problem tickets left open. I just needed to elaborate the problem and they fixed it in the first call/ticket. 
Cirrus Hosting,www.cirrushosting.com,Mike,"Tuesday, September 25, 2012","I'm sorry to say this but I used to be very happy with things but in the past year or so my experience has not been good. Recently, all my database connections were failing. My site uses 3 databases and they all failed one evening while I wasn't performing any work on my sites. Support said it was the fault of my scripts however these scripts had been working fine for 6 years. It didn't matter that I was right, Cirrus support staff refused to take my problem seriously and they spent  a great deal of time and energy trying to prove it was my fault and not theirs. Well, after a 12 hour outage, it finally started working again. When I asked for an explanation about what went wrong, they claimed that they never did anything to fix the problem. Well after the exchange of a few more nasty emails, I asked them to close the ticket before we both said things we would regret. I've made up my mind to move my sites to a new company. Something has changed within this company in the past few month and it's certainly not  for the better."
Cirrus Hosting,www.cirrushosting.com,Robert Sewell,"Thursday, September 13, 2012","Thanks for the help. Tech support helped me get my 'Coffee Cup FTP' connected to Cirrus again. For some reason, it seems that Cirrus wanted my password confirmed or updated or something. I 'changed' to the very same password and was then able to connect to Cirrus again. "
Cirrus Hosting,www.cirrushosting.com,John,"Thursday, August 30, 2012","I tried Cirrus and I really hoped that they would be able to serve my sites. This was just not the case. I experienced so much down time and connection errors that it became impossible to stay. I was restarting the server sometimes 5 or more times per day. I had database connection errors due to too many connections. Support attempted on multiple occasions to resolve the issue, and for a short time (about 3-4 weeks) they did.  Then the servers went down for Cirrus upgrades and all my sites went down with them. On this upgrade customers had about 6 hours notice. Once again all the sites slowed to a crawl and the connection errors began to happen again. On the main site I was running which was providing me with income, the traffic fell so low that my profit fell from $900 month to $60-$90 per month. The site was pulling $900 from traffic on a shared host, I was on the vps recommend by Cirrus sales based on the traffic figures I provided when I was originally switching. Long story short, I have moved my sites and I am once again experiencing excellent site growth and lightning fast response. My opinion of Cirrus is there is someone in hardware service that does not know their job and is going to drag the whole company down with them. The only good thing was the setup was fast. I could go on and on about all the bad points. Research before you buy, I didn't do enough and I was burnt for far too long hoping they could solve the problems and I was being convinced by their support department that it was one of my sites. (Nothing has changed on the site and it's running super fast at the new company I am using) Cirrus - figure out who is setting up/running and maintaining your servers that really does not know the job or many of your clients are going to leave just as I have. I will never go back and I hate that I was not able to stay because I was very happy that they were a Canadian company."

But later I am amazed with their server performance and excellent help in all the way of my installations, that's what one should look in a company for the service.

WebHostingZone,www.webhostingzone.org,David Carli,"Thursday, June 20, 2013",I have been with the owner for about a year now. He used to do some server adjustments for me when I was on another companies dedicated server. When he first told me that he could serve my sites I said no because it would have been a shared server structure. I used to be on one of those slow turtles and had a hard time in Admin with my WP site because the server was so slow. It took like 60 seconds to go to another page. That is why I changed to a dedicated server. When I finally did place a site with WebHostingZone I couldn't believe it. I am now on a shared server and I have never never never seen my pages come up so fast. It's like instantaneously. So how I feel is that there are some companies who are squeezing every profit out of the system they can. Then there are other companies like WHZ that truly care about the customer. Keep it up guys.

It is so bad that my site was always down and every single website is run on the same ip address.

IceStorm,www.icestorm.com/,David,"Monday, April 13, 2015","IceStorm was one of the FIRST hosting companies I ever signed up with over a decade ago! Being a webhost for over a decade -- what does that mean? That means EXPERIENCE! To me, ""experience"" means a lot. It means that not only can IceStorm handle whatever problems pop up, but it ALSO means they have the experience to KEEP PROBLEMS FROM HAPPENING! That's one of the things I like about IceStorm. The other thing I like is the owner, Adrian, is really really helpful. All the little ""special customizations"" I asked for -- NO PROBLEM! See, nowadays, it's almost IMPOSSIBLE to even be able to communicate with a company owner. Very rare indeed. But now look at IceStorm -- I can send Adrian an email with any question or request, and he emails me right back. THAT is the main reason I keep having IceStorm host my websites. Whenever I have a new website, I just hop onto IceStorm, and in less than a day, I'm up and running, and everything works. And, finally, I'm a real person. I don't work for IceStorm, and I was NOT paid to write this review, and I'm not even going to link to my own website -- I don't want anything in return. Rather, I guess I'm doing this for good karma -- if someone reads my review, and signs up with Icestorm, they will be happy, and if there is such thing as Karma, well, then I've got some good karma coming my way!"

Infinityhosting,www.infinityhosting.org,Anny,"Monday, January 27, 2014","I operate two online shops dedicated to natural cosmetics. As both shops grew rather big recently, I had to switch to a more powerful hosting. As my previous provider was way to expensive when it came to vps I had to look for another one. With Infinityhosting I have found a provider who can offer me a great price while providing a great service, good performance and an easy to use configuration. I can warmly recommend it especially to people who are new to all this. One star off only for a recent downtime that exceeded their 99.9% uptime guarantee. But according to them this was caused by a attack on their UK datacenter and out of control."

I must say I'm more and more impressed with the constantly improving service, reliability and speed that Infinity hosting offers. As their customer for more than a year, I must say I was lucky to discover Infinity and I sleep well, knowing my sites are in good hands. But most important is their support, who reacts with the speed of lightning if there is a problem.  And they also have a live chat! I would definitely recommend them to everybody, no matter of what kind of hosting service is needed."

My old hosting provider got kinda slow and support was not that good. After a long search I decided to give Infinityhosting a try, and so far I do not regret it. I purchased their Semi Dedicated Server (smallest plan) and at this time I operate 4 websites on it which generate around 30GB traffic per month, so they are quite big. Performance is great and the control panel makes managing multiples sites very easy and convenient. Their support is also great and probably the best I've ever come around so far. They are almost always replying within just a few minutes and very helpful. The 24/7 support is not just words, it really is 24/7. I can totally recommend this hosting company and hope that they will keep up their great service for a long time."
localnode,www.localnode.net,Rick Glatz,"Monday, April 15, 2013","I've used several hosting companies, and this - by far - was the easiest to transition into. The support staff is top notch and has been invaluable every step along the way. The service itself has been reliable as any, but what sets these guys apart is that they treat me as if they're ""on my side"" instead of as some anonymous/disposable source of funding. I highly recommend this service!"
localnode,www.localnode.net,Jane Gilmore,"Monday, March 11, 2013","Can't recommend localnode highly enough. The plans are very flexible and well priced and the support is amazingly good. Response within minutes any time I've needed them and they go way above and beyond the call. We tried a few different hosting sites and had problems with all of them. Localnode has been brilliant, I couldn't think of a single negative thing to say about them."
localnode,www.localnode.net,Betty Blanke,"Monday, March 11, 2013",I am very happy with my host. From the minute I signed up they were there for me. They are wonderful with getting you through the set-up time. They are with you when you need help. I even got personal phone calls to help me walk through things. Another thing that I like about this company is they are with you even after the setup. I feel that I can contact them anytime with a question or a problem. The site is always watched so you do not have to worry about people getting in and hacking your site. Last but not least is the price. It is very affordable. I have a small store with them. I do not make a lot of money. Because of the prices I can afford to stay on and try to sell my items. They work very hard to get you out on the web in as many places as possible.

However problems started when trying to host Typo3 websites: the performance was terrible and unacceptable despite the cheap hosting price. In other words the price specs ratio was great, but price performance terrible.  One and half week ago during the Joomla days in the Netherlands I heard a lecture about SiteGround and I gave them benefit of the doubt and became customer and moved my personal site with subdomains.

Strato Hosting,www.strato-hosting.co.uk,Gavin Murrell,"Thursday, September 8, 2011","I would recommend that anybody considering Strato for their hosting, avoid them at all costs. Their Customer Service is the most shocking I have ever experienced with only one member of staff seemingly willing to help in any way. They are only focussed on taking your money and once they have you in a contract fail in every respect to provide anything near the service they claim to offer Avoid Strato at all costs unless you want your business to suffer!   "
2Fun Host,www.2funhost.net,Tamanna Rahman,"Thursday, December 5, 2013",I enjoy the service of 2Fun Host last one year  ago. Solid hosting company with an excellent personality.

Boldhosts,www.boldhosts.com,Maria Lopez,"Monday, July 23, 2012","I came across this site while looking for another hosting service. I currently use BoldHost.com. The service not any cheaper that any other hosting service. As as far as the hosting itself about average. However my response is to a complete lack of customer service. This is the second time in less than a week that I could not log in to Cpanel, receiving only an error message that the server was full. After emailing support (and I use that term loosely) I finally after 24 hour received a responce ""All Staff Are Busy. Please Check on Your End"". Based on the response and the time taken to reply, I would not recommend. It really isn't a matter of cost for me I would gladly pay $3-$4 dollars a month elsewhere for proper customer service. Oh and I guess I should mention the seven days it took them just to register my domain name."
Boldhosts,www.boldhosts.com,Dieter,"Monday, May 21, 2012","Been hosting my personal and business email with Boldhosts now and I am not having problems with anything. They have fast servers which I just paid for 4 months in advance, something I'd never do if they were no good."

Hetzner,www.hetzner.de/en,Ben Aarts,"Friday, February 7, 2014","They charged a fee for a service that others get for free, when mailing support they did not care and it is not their problem. It has been charged so no turning back. The evidence is very clear as the service in question mentions for free everywhere on the site. They even changed the site after the complaint to make it even more clear that is is free... maybe a form of German humor. Extreme arrogant support staff. Besides the bad support the network has lots of packet loss making their servers a bad choice for streaming services (or anything that needs a stable connection). They undergo lots of DOS attacks on their network. Do not do business with, bad choice."
Hetzner,www.hetzner.de/en,Calum Coburn,"Tuesday, December 24, 2013","We tried to give Hetzner a go, and left aghast before we could even login to our account. Here are some of the reasons: 1. we received an email from Hetzner warning us that our IP was being used to send spam BEFORE WE HAD EVEN LOGGED INTO OUR SERVER. When we informed Hetzner of this embarrassing fact, their response was shocking, they didn't care, never-mind apologise. 2. Their login credentials didn't work, so we were delayed by days. 3. They didn't respond to multiple email support requests to have our language changed from German to English. 4. We had to endure a snotty young man in Accounts when we exercised our right for a full refund within the 14 day window. He was insulting and didn't keep his work on multiple occasions. We were forced to email his manager directly and to call the front desk to be passed through to his manager to have the issue resolved. His manager resolved the refund issue, but didn't get back to us to account for his subordinate's outrageous behaviour. Hetzher were trying to make it as difficult as possible to claim a refund, with a request for a signed fact and more. In short: avoid these bandits like the plague."

Natcoweb Corp.,www.natcoweb.com,Zack,"Thursday, November 22, 2012","I have been with Natcoweb for a small period of time and I wanted to submit a review of their stability, customer services and support.Service:- Sign up process was easy and I think not traditional for web hosting companies of today. After submitting payment I didn't get VPS details right away. It took about an hour (long time to wait as for me). Looks like they do not have automated setup. They explained that as a measure for customer verification but everything is great for now. During the last months of using them I have not experienced any downtime. I had several reboots which were caused my scripts installed there. Customer service:- Pretty fast but not super fast. I believe that is not a must though. They have responsive representatives which always reply in polite vein. It is always a pleasure for me to talk to them. Support:- Their support helped me, they installed (setup) bind for DNS, webmail,  helped with scripts. Also they opened me port #25 only on Monday."

I used Cart2Cart to migrate my shop from osCommerce to Shopify and everything went great, with no disruptions.  I was anxiously bombarding their support with question the entire time, and they showed me nothing but respect and helpfulness - no matter how silly the questions were.Thanks for your patience guys, Ill definitely use your service again. A well deserved 5 stars! "
Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Mike,"Tuesday, April 5, 2016","Very happy with the service and support - these guys are a pleasure to work with.

Get ready to days of excuses, vague responses a lot of "" our apologies, I understand and we cannot tell you when it will be fixed"" And my personal favorite "" maybe tomorrow"" . To make things worse, test migration works, just not the full migration. I ended up disputing the credit card. "
Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Nick,"Tuesday, March 29, 2016","Excellent!I had no problems with the service, whatsoever. I switched from WooCommerce to Magento, and Cart2Cart has really saved me lots of time - its an annoying and time-consuming monkey work to migrate manually.Everything went smoothly except for the minor hiccup with product images, which they resolved right away, as I informed their support. So, by all means, I approve and definately use the service again if I ever need to transfer data!Thanks Cart2Cart!"

Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,"Leslie Trotter, DC, MBA, CPedC, MSc","Friday, February 19, 2016","I too would give this company a ""zero"" star rating if it were possible. They have a ""no refund"" policy so we lost $700 Cdn...even though they did NOTHING but leave a mess.They are not available by phone. They are in the Ukraine and when they leave the office at 6pm their time zone, those of us on EST have a mere few hours to try and track them down. The email communication lags are days...not hours. When they say, ""yes, we can do that..."", it actually means ""No...we have no idea what we're doing"". They are using an old API system that most carts no longer use.So...be forewarned...you will end up doing the migration yourself or paying another company to do it many, many weeks after you paid this disingenuous company!!"

Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Mario,"Friday, February 5, 2016",I was sceptical about automatized migration services until Ive used Cart2Cart. It saved me a lot (I mean A LOT) of time on data transfer and moved all the 301 redirects just perfectly. Strongly recommend.

These people completely wasted three days of my life with back and forth mandate questions and screenshot requests.  And you will get bombarded with emails of employees asking you to repeat the same troubleshooting steps over and over again.  Complete idiots.  I hate to be disrespectful, but the fact that companies like this are in business is just plain'ol wrong.   STAY AWAY!!!"

Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Prem Mulberry,"Friday, July 17, 2015","I just spend a lot of time building a Wordpress online store to replace an old Joomla one.  Cart2Cart has what they call a Demo Migration.  I thought it would demonstrate what Cart2Cart was like to use and what the results would look like.  Turns out it wiped out most of the work I had done and to have it fixed they have to get into my old and new sites, which I don't trust at all.  Now I'm looking at redoing hours and hours of work.  Cart2Cart is expensive and not worth beans.  Zero stars."
Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Tyler,"Monday, April 27, 2015","We are migrating our website from nopCommerce to Magento. The package we purchased is closed to $600. Cart2Cart asked for our live Magento install credentials and then simply mentioned ""we'll get started soon"". Despite my request of when they would be getting started they simpy responded with ""as soon as possible"". A couple of days in I attempt to access my Magento instance for development and it will not load - looks like they got started. Luckily my ""live"" magento wasn't live yet.  Their customer service is nonexistent. Per three request I make for status updates I get a response saying ""our team is working on this and will provide you with the test import data when it is ready"" when I asked for a timeframe (not an exact time mind you) they respond with ""Sorry, we cannot provide an estimated time frame."" However, they don't mind marking the job as urgent for you if you wish. For the record, I have not sent an exhausting amount of update request to the project rep for Cart2Cart - so they have no reason to not respond. The only way I have been able to get someone to respond timely is by getting a chat representative on the case - who then connects me to someone who can't tell me anything. I look forward to telling my CTO that I gave $600 dollars away to a company who won't provide an update and all that they've managed to do is migrate products (a small part of the project) with incorrect inventory."
Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Stephen,"Tuesday, April 21, 2015","We paid Cart2Cart for the service of migrating our shop from BigCartel to Shopify.  In doing so, inventory numbers for all items were increased to 1,000 (rather than just 1 or 2).  In contacting Cart2Cart to rectify the situation, they told us that the problem is something that can't be helped.  Despite them admitting that the problem is an existing one that they are well aware of, they made no attempt to mention it on their site, before or after checkout.  Furthermore, when we asked for a refund for the incorrect/incomplete service, their staff refused the refund and blamed us for not catching the inventory problem during the demo migration.  It has been a long time since I have been this disgusted with a company."
Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,Steve,"Monday, March 24, 2014",Very disappointed with Cart2Cart service. I paid them $299 and they all I received was a run around. It has been over 6 months and they still will not make things right and I have spent hours on chasing them around. Looks like I can kiss my $299 goodbye.

Cart2Cart,www.shopping-cart-migra..,George Packsly,"Friday, September 14, 2012",Impressive service. I moved two stores from osCommerce to Magento by using different export/import modules and it was a disaster. That is why when I first heard of Cart2Cart I was rather skeptical.

The support is top notch; always responsive to questions, ideas and requests. Compared to a lot of other larger companies who offer cart abandonment technology, they have a much more affordable solution that's agile, and just plain works. I'm looking forward to seeing them grow. Oh, and it actually does work, as we have seen instant results for all sites we use their solution for. "

Earth Skater has built my website into what I think is better than any of my competitors. "
File2Cart,www.file2cart.com,Joseph Fox,"Thursday, August 2, 2012",What I liked the most about the service was the speed of import. As I value my time I was looking for the fastest product import solution and I found it in File2Cart. 
Flying Cart,www.flyingcart.com,Brian Forsberg,"Thursday, October 15, 2015",They do not have dedicated support for sellers. You must contact by email and you are likely not toget a resonse. The site has the feel of an automat. Nobody is there to  serve you ifthe coffee machine breaks down or your sandwich gets stuck in the vending machine. Standard photos are resized to squares on the home page meaning your products have a chopped appearance. The submission form forproduct details often compresses a copy and paste transfer. I will call paypal to see if I really have a shopping cart set up. I was told google analytics was automatic but the site says I do not have google. I am supposed to have a 1000 product limit under a %9.99/month plan. The side bar menu must be manually moved to add a category one line at a time toget it in alphabetical order. What can I say...my excitement has turned sour. I will check with homestead/intuit to see there plans. Lets see if these administraters at flyingcart get off their rumps. Instead they even promote the etsy site. To busy to run their own.

Uniecommerce,www.uniecommerce.com,Victor Bates,"Friday, August 1, 2014","We found numerous flaws in the multi-vendor software that made no sense from an ecommerce perspective such as:1.  All forms that contain an address use a drop down field for the city which must be pre-programmed to contain the city of your customer. There is no way you can know which cities, out of the hundreds of thousands of cities in the world, that your customer lives in or will wants to ship to. Just ridiculous. When we brought it to their attention they wanted to charge us an exorbitant fee for ""development"" to fix it. Later we found out that they had already done the fix for an Australian site and wanted to charge us again for fixing something they had already fixed for another customer.2.  There is no way to delete products or coupons that you don't want to display on any of the sites. And no way to search for transactions by date or period of time such as by the day, by the week a certain month or certain time segment. You can only search by the customer's name or order number, one-order-at-a-time. Again, extra charge to fix.3.  No coupon field in the checkout page to be able to use coupons.4.  Cannot edit policy or terms of use displayed text unless you pay them every time you want it updated. And when they do it the English grammar is poor.There are many more problems which they will be glad to fix for extra cost making the final bill at least twice their advertised price. Not enough room here to list them all.Company refuses to use any kind of legitimate 3rd party escrow service to guarantee, after repeated delays in delivering software on time, an acceptable end product. Also many of the Gallery of sites they display on their website I found out are not real companies or merchants. They made them up for show in their gallery. Spending some time drilling down into each of the sites show pages to don't contain anything real and don't go anywhere. Fake companies and products."
Vendio Services,www.vendio.com/,Joe Schmuckatelli,"Thursday, September 13, 2012","If you sell on eBay and Amazon, or want to, Vendio is the way to go! Fees are based on number of high-level SKU's (very favorable for product variations like clothing). No fee as a percentage of sales, and no annual contract. Very powerful order management, inventory management, and shipping integration. Areas of improvement are overall ease of use (it's a power tool), but their support team is great.  "
X-Cart,www.x-cart.com,Robert,"Thursday, December 17, 2015","We had been running X-Cart for 3 years.  Had to close our store because we had nothing but problems with X-Cart.  Lots of integrity issues, Google said the Mobile Module has lots of issues such as the buttons being to closes to each other and gave it a very low ranking.  X-Cart Tech Department told us to stop using the Refine Filters and Infinite Scroll Modules as they have issues.  I highly suggest you don't invest a dime in X-Cart software.  We had full Tech Support and they could not fix the issues.  Some issues they said were not covered by Tech Support and wanted us to pay a ton of money to fix them.  X-Cart Techs will blame 3/4 of the issues on your server host and try to get you to switch to their hosting.   In most cases you will turn in a Tech Support request and get an e-mail within the following couple days saying they need more info to work on the issue.  It does not matter how detail you make your request.  We had some support request handed to personal that were heading out of the office on vacation.  Over all experience with X-Cart was a nightmare each day.  "

I was browsing through their tools on their website and a chat box popped up that I thought was a bot at first. But the girl, Judy, helped me out and showed me some very cool examples of contests that other tanning studios did. All in all, the results were good and I am likely going to run another giveaway once the busy season ends. "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Campbell,"Tuesday, May 12, 2015",Customer service was good but its because they realize how faulty the product is. My campaign crashed while it was running which was a total disaster which meant extra work for my team following up with confused users asking why they cant participate in the photo contest. Its seems like they are good at marketing themselves but the actual product needs a lot of tweaking before it can said its reliable. Two thumbs down!

The results were slow at first but was gradually picking up. Got a few orders out of the leads from the landing page.  Overall good stuff. "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Jenny,"Tuesday, April 7, 2015","Wishpond is an unethical company. Our experience with them was shocking and we are still meeting businesses who have been duped by them. They lull you into a false sense of security by signing up on a trial basis then remove a full years subscription from your account without warning and then absolutely refuse to refund your money. Bree, one of their 'representatives' and current 'face' of the company, is particularly unhelpful. It has happened so many times now we are actually gathering statements and taking our case to trading standards. They should not be allowed to get away with this.  Clearly this is a recurring problem and they have engineered their process so they can scam people. Maybe the company is in financial trouble and this is the only way they can make money or maybe they only care about the big companies, either way its a shame because the actual product is ok. However if you a small company, start up or charity, this can be devastating. We are not all big corporate, blue chip organisations and therefore a full years subscription can be quite debilitating when you have not budgeted for it. I assume that's why they offer the monthly payments...? Our recommendation? Steer clear of this company"

I loved it too.- Contest tool is the best among all other (similar) which is easy to use.- Though I use MailChimp, I tried the email tool and it is quite good too.Overall, it's a great platform that I will definitely recommend."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Alejandro,"Tuesday, March 17, 2015","After reading the reviews I got a bit curious, they are either 1 start or 4-5, and most of the bad reviews seems related to refunds or charges. I need to use landing pages and a sweepstakes so I thought to give it a try. First I needed to look whether they offer refunds and it seems like their refund policy is fair, I don't want to commit for a yearly plan yet, but I want to try it for free, so I selected the yearly plan and moved to monthly. The landing pages creator are not as flexible as unbounce, and need some CSS knowelege, they told me they will have a new product soon. 3/5 Their emails tools are really basic, I would still stick with Mailchim. 3/5 Their contest tools are solid, seems to be the easiest yet powerful 5/5. Support is also good, they offer live chat (css help, and js), and they offer a lot of different hours. The prices are also really good, way cheaper than most companies 5/5, I did not see anything murky about what they charge, I canceled my account before the 14 days and move to a monthly plan with out any issues.

These certainly aren't the only tools that  I could want or need, but what is offered is done fairly well with little to be desired.

All my interactions with them have been first class. Definitely the best marketing software I've used. They also have great content on their blog so if you get stuck for inspiration you can get some ideas. Thanks Wishpond! "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Cathy Miller,"Thursday, February 19, 2015","I came to this site looking for a landing page and I was pleased to see that they had many different options. They even had a page for exactly what I was looking for to showcase my ebook. Their interface is very easy to use, even for older people who dont know a lot about coding. After successfully creating a landing page, I became interested in the other services this website provides. The contests and coupons seem like a good idea, so Im going to try one of those next. The only thing I really hope they will incorporate soon is some kind of special support for users who need extra help. I want to utilize other Wishpond tools but I need more help than just the chat/phone support."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Bill,"Monday, February 16, 2015",Do not fall into their trap of the 14 day trial. Especially if you are running a short campaign. Signing up for the 14 day trial sets you up on the annual pay plan. Contacted them about the error and they kept saying they had fixed it in billing but they continued to ping my card every week trying to get the annual rate. Very poor business practice!
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Tom,"Monday, February 16, 2015","We used this website to build or first landing page and it worked great! We had a little trouble at first with navigating through the editor and it can be a bit much to look at if you have no idea what you're doing but after a while, this is very easy to use. This website makes creating landing pages so easy that you don't really need to know any kind of programming languages! Even though it's initially a bit much to look at, I definitely recommend using this website!"
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Robert Brannen,"Friday, February 6, 2015",We utilized wishpond to help promote or business. I was hesitant at first but decided to go with them to try and get more leads and traffic to my website. Traffic was slow for the first month or so. After that however we started to receive more traffic which in turn resulted in more business. I had originally thought about cancelling but am very glad I did not
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Claudiu,"Thursday, February 5, 2015","Wishpond is a marketing platform that does all the internet marketing while I sit back and relax. Signing up to this website was as easy as ABC with only my email address and password required after which I was able to create a landing page, contest, coupon, form or popup, all these meant to increase leads to my business website, facilitating B2B lead generation, B2C lead Generation, EBook download, better sales and also easier registration and use of the website. For any marketing and campaign needs, this is the website to sign up to especially given their very fair pricing and the 14-day free trial for each of its plans. :)Though, it is important to note that this platform only works best for someone who has some good online maneuvering skills."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Cody R.,"Tuesday, February 3, 2015","Very easy to use even for new people like myself with the really nice buttons at the top of the page directing you to exactly what you are looking for such as Facebook advertising or creating a contest. The customer service was great as well, quick to respond, and friendly. It's easy to sign up for too being able to connect to it using social media sites like Facebook and Twitter. The prices for the plans are pretty good for all you get and with the free trial you can try out whatever plan suits you for 14 days. Really well built overall and they definitely had the customers convenience in mind when building it."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Bojan Savikj,"Tuesday, February 3, 2015","I have used Wishpond on several occasions. I have created landing pages and contests. I'm satisfied with their service as the software is highly functional. You can basically start your campaign in 10-20 minutes. I really liked that, I run multiple campaigns throughout the week. The customer support is helpful, although they seem little too pushy at times. However, most of the websites and software I used before didn't even had a customer support, which makes me to appreciate the effort of Wishpond.  Nevertheless, the software is nicely organized and easy to use for me, but I think it would not be as simple as that for the average users that have little knowledge on software like this. But, that didn't change my mind to rate this company and software 5 stars. This is an exceptional software product that is helping me a lot. I'm really thankful for what they are doing. I can warmly recommend them to anyone. "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Chelsea Mee,"Monday, February 2, 2015","Have started using Wishpond for a range of campaigns with great feedback and results. The interface is very easy to use and support is very good.  Re support - generally quick to respond and very helpful. Can be a few dramas with time differences if you need things done quickly and the rest of the world is still on the weekend, however still able to get support if you require it urgently.  Was a little annoyed with not being able to use separate company domains for different campaigns running at the same time, however you can get around by using different embed methods. "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Taylor Evon,"Wednesday, January 28, 2015","They have a very good customer service section - if you have any questions, they're very friendly and get back to you quickly! The design of the site is very good in my opinion, aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. Creating landing pages, etc. is very simple even for beginners like myself - they have a tab at the bottom that says ""Show me how"" where you can find step by step instructions for anything you're having trouble with. I'm very impressed with the level of helpfulness the site gives the user - it was super convenient for me when using the website. The templates were pretty good, and if you're good at coding you can customize and make your own to fit your needs. Overall, it's well-designed, user friendly, and has tons of handy features that make the user experience more pleasant. Definitely deserving of 5 stars!"
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Christina,"Wednesday, January 21, 2015",Great tool selection. Not the most user-friendly interface as it takes time to really figure out whats what.

Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Jake Steingart,"Thursday, January 15, 2015","The photo contest will not allow anyone to upload a photo from their cell phone, so they will have to enter your contest from a computer with a web browser ONLY. Support is lost and they ignore the problem and expect us here in South Florida to collect 50 screen captures and each phone's particular before they will look into it. How about they support and diagnose their own trouble? Go find another service!"

Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,debra burrows,"Wednesday, December 17, 2014","We signed up for the 14 FREE Trial on 11/27/2014 and created a FB ad. which resulted in $4.68 of clicks. Then we created a Pinterest pin contest via the app. Within days WISHPOND began taking funds from our account. It took several days to get a response from billing and after repeated emails, we finally were refunded our money. During that time of 7 days, we shut down the contest and let Wishpond know that we did NOT want a subscription to their service due to the trickery. However, on DEC 11, they took another $340 from our account upon which we emailed both billing and called the support number. That evening, we received an email stating that they would refund only PART of the money that we intended on charging us for 1 month of service. I replied 3 times in writing, and 3 times by phone. We waited 6 days, and still NO reply to any of our communications. As result, we froze the account they have on file to prevent any more unethical action and are still waiting for a reply stating that a credit will be issued to us. "

Since this, wishpond has reached out to me personally and they have graciously refunded me. I would like to thank them for this. If my future needs could take advantage of functionality that they offer (their platform is compelling and certainly has its merits) I will include them in my shortlist. This four-star rating is for their professionalism and customer care. "
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Antoy Adamis,"Monday, October 27, 2014","I understand all the billing problems this company has, most of the issues seem to be around users forgetting to cancel and giving bad review because of this, I do think is a bit unfair to leave a bad review because you forgot to cancel. I am not going to talk about the prices but about the product, so far it's been great, email marketing   landing pages in one single place is a lot of value. I singed up for the monthly plan and there hasn't been anything weird on my account, they actually send me a free shirt and a free USB!, I tried leadpages, and they both seems to be good.I leave 4 starts since sometimes they do have some bugs."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Christian,"Friday, October 24, 2014","v disappointed with this company - but perhaps it's my fault for not performing sufficient due diligence. Otherwise I might have discovered the raft of other negative reviews.I signed up for the monthly plan. I immediately encountered bugs when trying to use the functionality. Requested Support. Was assured by the 'very nice sales person' that my request would be treated with priority. Then, radio silence (their Helpdesk doesn't have an automated ticketing system which is mystifying for a company that boasts of their talents in email campaigns).Meanwhile, their Finance Dept was very prompt at taking my payment. I wish their IT Dept was equally adept and conscientious.I have requested a full refund from the 'very nice sales person' (after 48 hours of trying to get anywhere with minimal results). Instead, I get automated email messages inviting me to VIP workshops of solutions tailored to my specific requirements.My specific requirement is acknowledgement of my request to terminate my plan and be refunded. But, nothing. Not a word. No reply.  "

Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Jen Mahon,"Tuesday, August 26, 2014","Same as Tyler Byrd - I signed up for the 14 day free trial, cancelled 3 days into the paid plan, and was then very surprised to see a $265 charge on our credit card. It is an oversight on my part, because the sign-up page is set up to auto-charge for a non refundable annual plan after the 14 days. But this is a terrible way to do business - by roping people into an annual plan after a free trial, then refusing to refund even when the service was used for just 3 days.  I've never come across a service that charges for an annual plan after a free trial...it's an obvious way to trap people into annual plans when they're just getting to know the service."
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Jen,"Wednesday, April 2, 2014",The store is one of the best around here.Thanks
Wishpond,www.wishpond.com,Tyler Byrd,"Thursday, January 2, 2014",Watch out for misleading sign up practices. We registered for a monthly payment feature and they charged us for a full year. When we contacted them they agreed that their sign up practice is misleading but refused to refund money. If you are a reputable company why would you refuseto refund client money on a misleading sign process? 
Tiger Pistol,www.tigerpistol.com,Jess,"Tuesday, January 5, 2016",The worst Experience! They promise the world and can deliver nothing is return! So expensive for something I could of done myself!

Big Like,www.biglikeco.com,Gary McPhereson,"Friday, November 16, 2012",Big Like has been a great solution for my business. It adds all of the basic functionality that Facebook didn't implement on its own. Customer service is great and they helped me get up and going on live chat. Including tips for what types of content to post on my sweepstakes and even helped make my cover image look better. A for support! The pricing is reasonable and in line with competition. The mobile apps have been successful and people can also scan the QR code with their iPhones. All in all setup took about 45 minutes. Our Facebook page looked bare and empty before and now we have a cool conversation occurring just about every day.

Testuff,Write a review,David Pearce,"Monday, February 1, 2016","Over the years I have used many test management solutions...Testuff is the only one I've come across which has great status reporting capabilities while actually making life easier for the poor tester to create and maintain test cases; most seem to take care of the former at the expense of the latter.The support  team are excellent; tickets typically get resolved not just a response within 24 hours and so far the three feature enhancements I've submitted have been implemented within 1 -2 release cycles.The only thing I dislike about this product is the name: it's  a little cheesey and I found it a little off putting in a Fischer Price 'My First Airport' kind of way. I nearly didn't look at the product because of the name, which would have been a great shame as it's the solution I was looking for."

I've used  Zephyr and another forgettable tool in the past, and so far have found Testuff to provide a very nice experience in project and test case management, and test assignment/execution. I have not explored the requirements feature, nor have I made much use of the reporting feature. However, and above all, the customer support I have received from Testuff to date has been OUTSTANDING. For this reason I think this is a great solution that you can be confident about trying. Note that my project team sizes are small and generally last only 12 weeks, so I have no idea how it works with larger products with thousands of test cases and tens of testers.  "

Tempworks Software,www.tempworks.com,Michael Hairston,"Tuesday, April 19, 2016","TempWorks is a very easy to use, wonderful software package and service.  To my surprise, almost every path was thought of in the rich feature set it provides. This software has allowed us to not only operate on a level much higher than a company of our size normally would, but it has allowed us to scale in growth without breaking a sweat.I can list so many features of this software that make it invaluable, but I suspect one's due diligence will lead them to the same conclusion.  The thing that you will NEVER be able to determine until after you have decided is how a company will treat you after ""the sale"".  How is their service?  How is their support?  This area alone is what gives the company 5 stars in my book.  I have never experienced a company with the level of personal and thorough support as I have with TempWorks.  They are responsive, knowledgeable and work to solve any problem I might have with a sense of urgency.  When I contact them, I am treated with respect.  I have had issues with payroll and they have stayed hours past closing to ensure we were taken care of.  I still keep in touch with our implementation team as they were THAT professional and impressionable.  And EVERY single technical support staff member is courteous and a pleasure to communicate with.  We selected TempWorks, not because of the features they offer, (although they would have passed our test on that front), but because they operate with a strong set of values that is very hard to miss.  I have worked from the owners to the support agents and I always feel like I am dealing with someone in my own family or company.  I STRONGLY support TempWorks."
Tempworks Software,www.tempworks.com,Natalie Bement,"Friday, April 15, 2016","After being with the same company for nearly 18 years we decided to make a software change that would support our company's continued growth.  After a great deal of research into numerous software programs, we decided to go with TempWorks.  We are extremey pleased with our decision and have been surprised at all of the ""extras"" they have to offer that we were not aware even existed.  The conversion was as seamless as possible and their support team was there for us 100% of the time.  My only regret is not going with them sooner! "

I realize that that we have only been a customer since May, 2015 but we have found the TempWorks software and the support team has gone far beyond expectations to ensure the success of our team.With over twenty years of experience in the staffing industry, I had not found an ATS company that was truly interested in the partnership with their customers until now.  Eclipse made a decision to utilize the software and support of TempWorks and within a very short time period, four weeks, your team was able to convert five (5) years of data, provide exceptional training, handle report customizations and have us operational twenty (20) days earlier than our project plan.  I feel that this alone is testimony to the great team you have developed at TempWorks.Thanks to the great job your team has done, Eclipse has already seen improvements in our overall efficiencies, User Acceptance along with an improved customer experience.  We are truly appreciative of all the support thus far and look forward to partnering with the TempWorks team for years to come."

Our company has gone completely paperless which was our original goal with the use of the Applicant Center and Infinity version of software.  While it sounds like others have had struggles, I can tell you that I have not had the same experience.  Transition to a new software is always a challenge and each program comes with its own difficulties - it is never an easy road.  My experience with three of the large staffing company software products is why I'm giving this review.  We have people up and running in a week on Tempworks where we used to have two weeks of dedicated software training. Feel free to contact me for more information."
Tempworks Software,www.tempworks.com,David Stemm,"Friday, April 24, 2015","TempWorks has a good software platform.  Unfortunately, the company surrounding the software is fundamentally dishonest with feckless leadership.  I signed a contract with TempWorks Management Services to provide, among other things, EOR services to my start-up.  The last business day before the first temporaries were being sent out, they told me they ""were not moving forward with my company.""  Again, temps were going out the next day.  They would not tell me why nor would they respond to any communication with me whatsoever.  Pathetic!  I got an attorney in Minneapolis and sued them in Minnesota court and won.  In the written judgment, the judge found President & CEO David Durgarian's testimony 'not credible'.  The judge found COO Mari Kautzman's testimony 'not credible'.  The judge found  Executive Vice President's testimony 'not credible'.  This is what these people were willing to do to try and mitigate their responsibility.  The President & CEO, COO and Executive VP were willing to give false testimony under oath.Since broadcasting my results, I have heard from - and learned of - dozens of companies across the United States who had problems with TempWorks and their egregious behavior, their dishonesty, their ruthlessness and their complete lack of ethics or business acumen.  I will happily provide to you a copy of the written judgment from Minnesota District Court which validates my story.  PLEASE contact me before signing a contract for any services with TempWorks.  If you decide to proceed with them, PLEASE have an attorney view the contract prior to signing as they, admittedly, bargained for language that protects them at the expense of their clients no matter what.

I have to log a ticket either into an obscure website or call one in - but nobody will assist me directly with my issues. I have started listing all of my tickets as ""Critical"" but they drag on for weeks with no resolution. It is very discouraging to sink a lot of time and money into a product that is not the easiest to use and then doesn't provide the customer service required to use it."

Veeqo,www.veeqo.com,Stefan Morris,"Thursday, May 21, 2015","We signed up for Veeqo a couple of months ago and we're already seeing the benefits of using an inventory management system to manage or stock across our webstores. Before we started using Veeqo we spend about an hour every day just writing out our shipping labels, now it takes minutes as Veeqo does this automatically. The customer service guys helped us though the setup, which was an enormous help. This kind of support is really important to us which is one of the reasons we rate it so highly - the team are quick to respond to all our queries and very friendly. Aside from customer service, the app is easy to use (which says a lot coming from someone who struggles with computers). All round great app, saves us loads of time, wouldn't do without it!"
Veeqo,www.veeqo.com,Lindsey Richards,"Wednesday, May 6, 2015","Brilliant app,  frees up a lot of time day-to-day to focus on more important things as we don't need to constantly be checking our orders between channels and fiddling around with shipping labels (which was getting very frustrating!). Love how it integrates with our Xero account so easily, which is another great time and effort saver. The team is great whenever we pester them with something (we're not the most tech-savvy bunch!) and they are always very helpful. Highly recommend this app!"

I have tried many other vendors and I can say with confidence nothing comes even close to the features and functionality of Snap.  From Multi-modal (Web, Mobile, Paper,) to Multilingual questionnaires all in the same survey, to Smart Reports (automatic reporting) Snap does it all.  Furthermore, their support is phenomenal. They always seem to answer the phone call on the first couple rings and cheerfully find and fix the problem. Most of the time its user error ;). That's my rap on Snap."

SoGoSurvey,www.sogosurvey.com,Wanessa,"Friday, May 8, 2015","I was looking for an online survey to use the data in my master thesis and I read good reviews about SoGoSurvey. I gave it a try and I was very happy with the results. You can create easily your own survey with lots of options to design it and customize it. To start you can watch some tutorial videos, but you can also start just by trying because it is really simple. You have several ways to send the survey: post the link on a website, share it on social media or send it by email. That can be an advantage if you want to reach different participants. After that you can also control the status of the invitations with the response table, which allows you to control how many people have answered your survey. In case you have some deadlines, this feature is very useful as you still have time to take some actions to be able to receive more answers. One of the reasons that I chose SoGoSurvey is the advantage of having the survey in different languages. In my case I couldnt send it in English, so it was mandatory to have not only the questions and answers that I created for the survey in my mother tongue, but also the instructions/commands. For me it was really helpful. Another feature that I like is preview survey that allows you to check how the survey would look like before you send it to the participants. When you are not happy with the outcome, you still have the option to edit the survey. SoGoSurvey is a good a survey toll for students purposes. I recommend it!"

We use it for most all of our surveys - some internal and some external with our partners. I rated it 5 stars overall because it can pretty much do everything from a survey perspective. I rated the customer service 4 stars because sometimes it's hard to understand them and I prefer to reach them over the phone vs. online. Lastly, only 4 stars for ease of use because when updates and/or changes are made, it's not always easy to get use to the changes but those at least are not very frequent. Maybe once a year but still it takes a little time to get use to. Overall, I'm very happy with the product and will continue to use it for the foreseeable future."

The Opinionmeter system, in our opinion, has several important advantages. OMI has been in the customer feedback-gathering and surveying business literally for decades. Whilst the technology has changed profoundly over that time, the company has reliably evolved its offerings in synch with that. Today we and our clients have in OM a multimodal survey platform to meet just about any conceivable requirement: mobile or fixed, intercept or self-initiated, large form-factor or tiny, online or offline, even paper forms. And, it all just works seamlessly. This is not the place for a feature list, but it's all there. Overall: If you are looking for a comprehensive, flexible, easy-to-use customer feedback and/or market survey system, you will find that Opinionmeter does it all, more comprehensively in our view than any competitor."

I like the $.10 per survey response. It ties the value of data to the amount paid, making it easier for businesses to adopt. Admin can limit responses to match budget. Also allows to embed videos and include skip logic.THE BAD: It's $.20 to white label surveys which removes the BIG call to action after survey is submitted to learn more survmetrics. T's & C's excerpt "" you are granting Company, its affiliates....without limitation, a right to copy, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, reproduce, edit, translate, and reformat User Content...""  Basically, they own everything and can do whatever they want with it.

Not exactly accurate and unbiased is it?Sends out letter to references from applicant regarding filling out the form.  Anyone knowing the applicant would recognize this letter does not sound like the applicant and would question whether this is legitimate.  Looks like a phishing scam.End of survey asks questions regarding the reference, also looks like a phishing scam.Suggests applicant remind any references that have not filled out form to do so.

We had a client who needed a job evaluation solution integrated with their job descriptions and HRTMS worked with us to add capabilities to make that happen.  Bravo!

Recognition PRO,www.recognitionpro.com,Ron,"Thursday, July 25, 2013","With the implementation of Recognition PRO, we have transitioned from always identifying the things employees do wrong & correcting them to a culture of acknowledging the things employees do right and recognizing them on a daily basis. The results are that we now find our employees making better decisions that positively impact our business, employees & especially our customers. One of the most rewarding things about having the Recognition PRO application a part of our business is seeing the positive reactions of the managers after they receive the reactions from our employees who have just been recognized for a job well done. Its quite wonderful and sustaining. After the initial launch of the Recognition Pro application, our employees & managers went from a mindset of apprehension to excitement & appreciation in a very short period."

My tax prep should have been free and I should have been offered a life like reimbursement since no one in the office knew how long they had been setting there and how many people see my soc sec number . The have lost my business for good and any one else I can convince to not return and pay the high fees !!!!!!!!!!!"

VeriClock,www.vericlock.com,Nick LoGrasso,"Monday, August 12, 2013","VeriClock is a phenomenal tool!  Anyone with a mobile workforce should use it.  Before implementing it in our business a few years ago, we researched a number of companies offering ""similar"" services.We found that VeriClock's features and ease of use were superior.  Additionally, the pricing was better.  We didn't know at the time how awesome the support would be, but it is excellent!  Anytime we need to speak with someone we do - a real person, and many times, directly with management.The ROI is significant.  Specifically, we only need to be 4 minutes more accurate on a timesheet per day in order for VeriClock to pay for itself.  Our employees no longer turn in timesheets that state they work from 8-4.  It is real-time data and shows real-time clock in/out events.  8:02-3:58 pays for itself.  We also thought the employees might have concerns about adopting the new software.  The learning curve is non-existent and our staff LOVE it!  No more paper timesheets to turn in, email, getting lost, or forgotten to be used during the day.Don't do business without this!  We've recommended it to all of our colleagues and associates."
VeriClock,www.vericlock.com,Monika Wittner,"Thursday, August 1, 2013",Our company has been using Vericlock for a few years now and we love the possibilities and flexibility it gives us. In construction managing a lot of crews and projects is super easy with this system. Employees clock in and out using their phone and can view their timesheets on a computer (with administrators permission). Mistakes and oddities are easy to notice and correct. We can track employees in real time and place (using GPS feature). Perhaps most appreciated is the flexibility reports give us. Tracking labor costs even on multiple projects takes no time and getting all payroll data ready takes 15 seconds. It is very easy to do job costing on everyday basis. I can create my own reports as I wish and save them for later use.  Overall the system is easy to navigate for both employer and employees. The level of convenience it brings deserves five stars! 
VeriClock,www.vericlock.com,Travis  Kunkel,"Wednesday, July 31, 2013","I have been very happy with my decision to use Vericlock. For my painting company, it was the perfect Solution. I use to have to pick up the time cards on the job sites and wait as my employees would fill out an entire week in front of me.  And everything was rounded up to the next half-hour. Now, it is down to the minute.  I know exactly when they clock in and out and I have instant access to their hours, how many hours spent on what job and how much total has been spent on the project up to that very minute. I am very happy and would suggest it for most businesses."
VeriClock,www.vericlock.com,Grayson Peters,"Wednesday, July 31, 2013","We love this virtual punch clock service and have been using it for years. We know where our workers are at all times, what they are doing, and everything is done in real time. Getting data ready for payroll has never been so easy. Employees can be given access to their time data IF the employer gives this permission to the employees - but at all times the party who created the account and pays for it has control over it. We have experienced no data loss or down time with VeriClock whatsoever. The only issues we have had using the system are related to our local phone carrier and have nothing to do with the VeriClock system - we have data going back several years."
VeriClock,www.vericlock.com,Nevyn,"Monday, June 10, 2013","Only issue from an employee stand point I see with VeriClock is that they do not keep records of clock in / out and they leave that up to the employer or so I was told by a VeriClock representative on the phone. It would be nice for an employee to be able to access his / her ""records"" with VeriClock through VeriClock which would be quite helpful when companies decide to end the employee id's and passwords. How does an employee who uses VeriClock access ""the cloud"" otherwise? This in my honest opinion is a big deal as they should retain such information (clock in / out and what sites) for ""questionable ethics"" of companies. Yes it would be nice for VeriClock to also have a ""back up"" file for companies and employees as there was once a ""hiccup"" in the system (I am not sure on who's end) but all info was lost and wages were lost. Because VeriClock keeps no records I do not recommend them. "
ClockIn Portal,www.clockinportal.com,Iraqi Embassy,"Wednesday, March 25, 2015",What I really like about clockin portal is the simplicity. It is a very easy to use clock in web-based application. I have access to timesheets and payroll reports all the time.

It gives me a clear perspective where each of my projects are that my staff working on, how much our billable work is and where we need to put more time in. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is the lack of a mobile app that would have been perfect for my staff who are always on the go. Give me that and you're all five stars to me. "

The complexity of a big company and the flexibility of GetMyTime allowed us to monitor employee's time and expenses more closely. GetMyTime was the only solution to our problem after trying out several. However, they lack the iOS app that would've made their product more perfect. "
GetMyTime,www.getmytime.com/,Ryan Carr,"Thursday, February 14, 2013",We have tried different time tracking tools for our company. GMT has been the most easy to use and economical.

GetMyTime,www.getmytime.com/,Justin Hernandez,"Wednesday, February 13, 2013","I have been handling company payroll for as long as I can remember. I've seen companies transition from old school bundy clocks to biometric scans. Despite the tenacity of biometric technologies, it requires employees to be in the office to clock in or clock out.

This was also a big factor in selecting AccountSight because the value for money is simply outstanding. The service definitely works out well for us."
AccountSight Software,www.accountsight.com/,Herman Ramsey,"Monday, December 9, 2013",I am currently using AccountSight and all I can say is that it's a great time tracking software. Now I can maintain my timesheets and invoices efficiently and I don't need to worry about it anymore. I am currently using the trial and I will purchase the premium version soon.
AccountSight Software,www.accountsight.com/,Brendan Ferguson,"Friday, December 6, 2013","We found the software easy and quick to use and learn. I admit that Im not the most savvy user when it comes to time tracking software (more hands on) but the dashboard helped, as well as the handy tutorial videos. The feature list is impressive and has everything that our company could feasibly require, but sometimes all you really want is functionality, simple to use software at an affordable price  thats what Id pencil in to the Pros column for AccountSight over alternatives that we have tried. If I had to comment on specific strengths, Id probably say that the system has ideal T&E; and billing solutions, especially for consulting. We specifically like the handy bulk feature used to mass load the twenty-odd-employee time and expense in a couple of minutes. At the end of the day it wouldn't take very much convincing to recommend AccountSight to other small or medium operations and you should waste no time in setting up a demonstration as I did."
AccountSight Software,www.accountsight.com/,Phil Thomas,"Thursday, December 5, 2013","Thumbs up from me. I found AccountSight very useful. Timesheet management, client billing, online reporting - in every aspect, it has powerful functionality. The rich dashboard provides a lot of insight and scope for data analysis. All in all, it's a great choice for project management."

Previously managers would approve hours once a week, now they do it daily. TimeWellScheduled is more beneficial for the department managers because they get to see exactly whats happening in their departments with regard to their staff coming and going...The information it holds is much more valuable than the old system.

It USED to be a big time sucker for us... but now, its easy and unbelievably more efficient. Within the first couple weeks of using it, I could see that it was going to be a huge advantage for us  a big labour load lifted off of my supervisors shoulders. Lets say we need 15 agents and 5 of them have to be bilingual. When we add our employees [into TimeWellScheduled], we identify which ones are bilingual so its really easy to drag and drop the right type of agent into those seats...Previously, we were using a spreadsheet. It was very easy to double-book somebody or make it look like you had enough seats filled but, in actuality, you didnt."

The quality of the data collected and the appearance of this tool is very good.
time cockpit,www.timecockpit.com,Stefan S.,"Wednesday, July 17, 2013","Easy to use, clean UI. My favourite feature is the application tracker: It tracks all programs and window titles you are working with, so you don't have to care about time tracking while doing work. You can reconstruct the things you've done afterwards comfortably. It also tracks the time you are not at the PC, so you don't have to look at the time when making lunch, because the program shows you the time you were absent."

I chose Yaware among other services because it is really ease to use.
Yaware.TimeTracker,timetracker.yaware.com/,Slice,"Thursday, September 6, 2012",Awesome company I love it. I use Yaware to keep track of my employees work and make sure they are doing their job!
Yaware.TimeTracker,timetracker.yaware.com/,Tanya Vysochanska,"Tuesday, August 21, 2012","The need for time tracker was caused by several factors. First is the increased number of employees, most of whom work on flexible hours. So we had to record somehow total hours worked. The next reason is that we work on highly competitive IT market and we simply can not afford using time inefficiently. That's why we constantly evaluate our productivity and optimize processes. Yaware service lets us see where we spend time inefficiently and better plan our time. We set the rate of productive time for employees, given the specificity of their work. Employees can see their productivity and hours worked themselves. Since we started using Yaware we've managed to increase the number of resolved tasks by at least 15%. Tatyana VysochanskaHead of Marketing Department at MagneticOne"
Abak Software,www.abaksoftware.com/,Eunice Bourgeois,"Wednesday, March 11, 2015","Weve been working on Abak software since 2011 and find its exactly what we need for our business.  With what the basic program offered to the customization of the software, I have not run into any issues we were not able to accomplish with Abak. Installation was seamless and the knowledgeable training staff took steps to ensure I was comfortable working with the program before letting me go on my own.  I really liked the homework portion of training, I felt it helped me retain the training very well.  As a naval architect/marine engineering firm our needs differ from client to client, Abak listens to what I need and works very quickly to solve it or shows me how to accomplish it within the program.  As the only administrative person I dont have a lot of time to spend learning new software and as a company looking to start with a new software we needed to have the software up and running immediately; which Abak did.   I found Abak very easy to learn and my questions/needs solved within 24 or less hours.  Starting with the basic implementation to where I am now becoming a Power User the software is performing very much to my satisfaction.  Abak was the only software I tested that gave me great customer service prior to the purchase and a year later they are still exceeding my expectations.  I definitely recommend Abak."

Teramind,www.teramind.co,Ricky Helmer,"Tuesday, August 30, 2016","As with any company, we have our own set of problem users. Even with best-in-class web and content filters, users tend to find a way to abuse the system. Furthermore, the built-in reporting capabilities of most filtering systems lack any way to pin-point and associate a particular incident with a user. This left us having to manually investigate when problems arose.During our research on a new employee monitoring solution, we trialled several of the major vendors products. All of which were either bloated, outdated, or difficult to setup and use. Thankfully, we found Teramind. We were immediately awestruck by the entire interface of their live demo. Their site also features a live chat that actually connected me directly to a real person after normal business hours, on a weekend! We ended up purchasing the on-pemise version of Teramind, which is available as a VM. This delivery method alleviates the setup difficulty we had with many other products. We then just deployed the hidden agents though group policy making our setup, all in all, entirely automated.To this day, the interface and reporting capabilities of Teramind remain unmatched compared to other products we have tried. Having an actual web interface means I can access Teramind without remoting into the server or installing a console on my administrative workstations. The colored charts and graphs make it easy to distinguish information. There are multiple reports available from website history and email, all the way to keystrokes and printing. Live and recorded sessions from the monitored users display also enhance our ability to track and view activity. Overall, Teramind is far more advanced than the other competitors. They are definitely raising the bar and I'll back them up any day."

Training JumpStart,www.trainingjumpstart.com,LuAnn Lodl,"Tuesday, September 23, 2014","I have been using Training JumpStart for a couple of years. We are very pleased with both the software and customer service. Without exception, they have responded very quickly to any request we have made. I like being able to control the content myself, but also have the option of having TJS staff help me at an additional cost if needed. (The cost for both the software or additional staff assistance has always been reasonable.)"
Training JumpStart,www.trainingjumpstart.com,Wendy Green,"Tuesday, September 23, 2014","The staff at Training JumpStart has been extremely responsive to every request we have made of them during our initial implementation of iJET University. From the very first interaction with Adam and Hadas, I knew that they put customers first and that was a big reason we decided to go with Training JumpStart. They were able to get our website up quickly and easily once we had all of our requirements worked out.  I am looking forward to growing iJET University and working with the Training JumpStart team to provide our customers with the quality they will expect."

To be honest, after working with some of the largest LMS providers and being used to issues or questions taking months to get answered or resolved, you can imagine my surprise when I soon discovered that any question, suggestion or help I needed, was responded to immediately and answered or resolved within days at the most. Even though we are far from their largest or only client, they always make us feel like we are the most important.  "

TryMyUI,www.trymyui.com,P Perera,"Thursday, July 21, 2016","If I could give them 0 stars, I would. These people offer a free first trial and yet when we signed up to do a test, they debited our account for it. They also have not delivered any results despite having created this test weeks ago.

TryMyUI,www.trymyui.com,Bart Borkosky,"Monday, January 4, 2016","I would give it Zero stars if available.  A) The co. is slow to find testers per the given specs.  B)They do not use a screening tool to ensure your testers actually qualify.  They advertise on Amazon Mech Turk and tell the participants the qualifications needed, so you don't really know if the people testing your site actually meet the criteria or not.C) The co. charged my credit card multiple times after being told we were not interested in a month-to month subscription.  They did not return multiple calls or emails.  We had to get the fraud dept of our credit card co. involved. "

I would have no hesitation in recommending their testing service to anyone looking at really getting inside their users heads.
Lodgify,www.lodgify.com/,Debbie Loy,"Monday, January 18, 2016",Be sure to read the agreement before listing with this company!!  Auto renewal takes place without notice or confirmation to customer.  If customer has year or multi-year agreement or one that includes more than one home that is level auto renewed (period).  If customer's needs have changed and level of service needs to be canceled or downgrade too bad.  Unless the customer does that 'prior' to auto renewal and credit card charge too bad so sad.   Customer service 'is more' than providing technical service.  Having fine print in agreement 'clearly' weighted to Lodgify and not a customer's needs is a predatory business practices.  Avoid this company or buyer beware read the fine print in the agreement very very carefully!!!

Spark Hire,www.sparkhire.com/emplo..,Olivia,"Monday, February 24, 2014","As a job seeker, I found Spark Hire super easy to use. I had to submit a one-way interview for a virtual position and didn't have any problems with the software. The best part about Spark Hire video interviewing is that I'm allowed to record and playback my responses numerous times before submitting. This was probably one of the best interviews I've done yet!"
Spark Hire,www.sparkhire.com/emplo..,Ron Wynn,"Tuesday, July 23, 2013",This is the easiest application that I have used for video interviewing. Super friendly. Great bells and whistles and you don't have to be a tech geek to master the site.

VidCruiter,www.vidcruiter.com/,Amanda Grace,"Thursday, January 31, 2013","This has cut my recruiting time in half, and I'm getting a higher quality candidate overall. Before VidCruiter we used to use spreadsheets and folders to track everyone, we never really had the time to check all references and we had to do multiple phone interviews. Now, Wow. Life is so much better. The system in one easy screen shot tells us who is at what stage in the process. The references are captured automatically and help give us a much better idea of who we are hiring. The video interview component has not only saved us time from at least 1 phone interview, but we have so far interviewed every person who has completed it. The quality candidates just filter themselves to the top. Overall this system is great! The customer service that VidCruiter offers is second to none. I have been impressed time and time again with the VidCruiter team answering any questions that I may have and adding features to my system very quickly. Sean and his team are extremely helpful, diligent, and professional! People who complete the video interview portion of the VidCruiter process seem to be more qualified, computer savvy, and willing to go the extra mile to be considered for the position. I love VidCruiter!"

The company was flexible in working with us, providing fantastic support along the way and was always responsive.  It's easy to use, has great features, and has made the change nothing short of seamless.  It has shown our company how great a software vendor can be.  For example, we have provided feedback and seen it upgrade in the next release only a few weeks later.  We highly recommend this product and this company!"
Proxyclick,Write a review,Jeffrey Baker,"Tuesday, February 2, 2016","As a former Homeland Security supervisor I can attest to the ease and accuracy of this system. We have a large flow of visitors/guests & employees who forget badges, everyday and Proxyclick makes it easy for me to see who's here, who's due, for how long the stay is, etc. The employees who have appointments coming can add them or they email me and I can add them to the system. It take just seconds. You can add an individual or a group, (that's really handy). This also makes it easy to know what visitors I have on property in case of an emergency. Ours is attached to a Dymo label writer that prints our visitor badges with time sensitive stickers. I can also give access badges to employees that forget theirs and just put the info in the system without having to print a visitor badge. This system gives me the freedom to just look to see how many I have in the building with a glance. Tells me if someone has added a visitor that may be a last minute add. It will email the visitor a reminder of the appointment, auto emails the employee when the visitor checks in, as a section for notes with the visitors name for any ""special"" instructions. I can go on and on with praise but will only add this, Customer Service is OUTSTANDING! I have a constant connection with them. I've never waited more than 3 minutes for a response via they ""live chat"" on the system page itself. These folks are true professionals. They will listen to your suggestions, (one of mine was put into use) and do all they can for you. I always feel like a valued customer with them."
Proxyclick,Write a review,Costas Moraitis,"Tuesday, September 22, 2015","Even though we were in the market for a replacement system on our antiquated paper based system and looking for ways to save on the expenditure with Proxyclick we have gained a lot more, we gained a visitor experience. We have deployed 11 sites using iPad kiosks and we are now looking to increase it to cover multi Country deployment. I was very surprised that most visitors mentioned Proxyclick positively when they arrived. Configured correctly it has given us greater benefits in a lot of areas, for example fire evacuation reporting, audit control, unified reception across all sites, multi entrance.Pros: Design, ease of use, very helpful support staff and pricingCons: You can't take visitors pictures on the iPad"
Proxyclick,Write a review,Mary-Kelly Mulligan,"Thursday, August 27, 2015","ProxyClick is an intuitive interface both for checking a guest in, as well as for alerting someone that their guest has arrived.

No canned responses here. Such a contrast. Within a few hours spread over 2 days, the site was up and running with faster performance. The support team worked through the myriad config issues (among many others!) with unfailing politeness, patience, professionalism, and downright HELPFULNESS in every case - as did sales. The price is reasonable but is almost irrelevant, we found, when compared to the our need for their excellent support and the flexibility to have our more unique needs met. "

VPS6.NET,Write a review,Epola,"Thursday, September 25, 2014","Do not ever make the mistake of considering this company for hosting, if your sites and data have any importance at all to you.  I was a long time customer of several years, and in the last 2 our VPS went down a total of 14 times, sometimes twice in the same month for days on end.Each time Tech Support, which is outsourced to India, tried to solve the problem they received absolutely no cooperation from management resulting in hours of waiting with no response as none could be given.  The VPS would be down for days at a time with nothing being done because management was either absolutely unbothered about or actually too brain dead to understand how to solve the problems they had with the data centre they were currently using at that particular time.  I say this because they kept changing data centers every few months because they kept being booted off by their current service provider. After all the chaos, their Service Level Agreement, promises a refund based on the downtime experienced.  It's all lies! The instant we tried to claim the refund, we were told that nothing would be done about it and if we decided to make a charge back complaint with our bank they would cancel our account effective immediately which they did do without a second thought.  Ron who was their Director was actually fired from the company for being a useless and lazy manager and has been replaced by people of the same caliber.They do not care about their customers, they even had to increase their fees due to the amount of charge backs they received from irate customers.  Do not feed these thieves.  They once were one of the best VPS providers in the business, but they've become lazy and work more like thugs.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THESE MONKEYS."

VPS6.NET,Write a review,Darren,"Monday, November 26, 2012",I've had the VPS (instant activation) since 10th November 2012 and all I got was slowness. They sorted it then it repeated itself. The VPS crashed and then I placed a cancellation request on 21 November 2012. I stated that I wanted a refund which it said to do in their terms and conditions. A Paypal dispute is in place and they claim that I didn't do such a thing. Buyers Beware.

The staff at VPS6 have always been extremely responsive when I've got any questions. For me, the best service is one of the most important issues when choosing a VPS."
VPS6.NET,Write a review,SK,"Monday, October 29, 2012","VPS6.NET has been around since early 2012. I found them when I was searching for a replacement for my email server. While I'm searching for their reviews, they launched the double RAM promo. I could not resist the great offer and created an account with them. My first VPS was in their LA node. After few days with them, the VPS is having connection issues and packet loss. I requested to migrate my VPS to Chicago node and no questions asked, my VPS was migrated immediately. VPS6 support is fast, and the price is very cheap with the specs. Give them a try :)"

VPS6.NET,Write a review,Denos,"Wednesday, October 3, 2012","I've had a VPS with them for a few weeks and have been surprised by the performance of the VPS and the quality / speed of support. Most of the time, I can find problems with budget providers (eg. using invalid SSL certificates for control panel access, slow disk, not using NTP on the host node, etc.) but these guys seem to have done everything right. I'll follow-up when I've been with them for a longer period of time."

VPS6.NET,Write a review,RafaelR,"Thursday, September 13, 2012","VPS6.NET is one of the few providers that I have had an exceptionally good experience with. I'm so glad I've decided to give my business to them. Their nodes feel rock solid, with fast and reliable network connectivity and to complement it all up, they are really a customer support oriented company.  I have to admit that I've pushed them really far by putting some pressure on their customer support. I have made all kinds of questions, I have pretended that I don't like their service; I have insinuated that I have no trust in their programs. Honestly speaking, I've tried to be a pain, literally. During different interactions with different customer support representatives, I have always received the same high quality and exceptional support  (yes; even when trying hard to be a painful customer to deal with). Having had multiple interactions with different employees and each time receiving good support and polite answers, to me, that speaks for itself. I've abandoned the idea of keeping on trying to be a 'pain' because these guys are honest men and women working hard for their money and certainly showing appreciation and care for their customers. If there were a 10 star rate VPS6.NET and its customer support would be it.  I'm embarrassed to admit that I took all my previous frustration with other providers up with them. They've been so good that I felt guilty at times, guys! I recommend anyone I know to consider them when looking for an honest VPS hosting provider. They are a win-win solution for customers at its fullest; competitive prices, rock solid infrastructure, great network speed and connectivity and the best customer support money can buy on monthly basis. I don't even know how they do it but they do deliver their commitments. You guys at VPS6.NET rock!"

VPS6.NET,Write a review,Matthew Weston,"Thursday, August 30, 2012","I have used VPS6net as my VPS hosting provider for nearly 9 months now, and they have been a rock-solid host. Their support is absolutely top-notch with support ticket replies in less than 30 minutes in most cases. Customer support is the absolute key to a good host, and VPS6net have nailed it. I have plenty of experience in regards to VPS hosting providers as I have been with over 10 other VPS hosts and VPS6net would certainly come out in top place. The friendly staff at VPS6net always endeavor to solve your technical and non-technical issues in a short time frame, keeping you up to date whilst it's all happening. VPS6net always keeps their OS templates up-to-date, and they also have a wide range of upgrades that you can apply to your VPS as your needs grow, meaning that you can start off with a relatively small VPS without any worries. I am currently on a Xen VPS package which is very stable as VPS6net do not oversell their services. The gigabit internet connection reaches amazing speeds, and I have had barely any downtime (only 1 major event where the hardware node crashed and had to be rebuilt) over my 9 months of using VPS6net. I have contacts from around the globe that have downloaded files from my VPS and many have commented on the fast download speeds that they have achieved from my server. Downloads from the VPS6net network seem to max out nearly all typical internet connections on a single thread  whereas other VPS network seem to only achieve good speeds when multi-threading a download. I live in Australia and I achieve ping times averaging 350ms, which is awesome for a US-based server. Overall, VPS6net has been an excellent host and I HIGHLY recommend it to other people seeking a cheap, stable and reliable VPS hosting solution. You will NOT be disappointed."

I am really glad my friend recommended me to them and I am planning to shift most of my sites to VPS6 looking at their vast location portfolio, it's almost perfect for every one of my sites. Also, their SolusVM has tons of different templates, I haven't really tried them because I rather install things myself but for those newbies, this might just be a great solution for you ;)"

However, sometimes you can't even start your server, other times you can't use the command line. But, when it all comes down to it, it's a good host. But if you want complete uptime, don't go for vps. Get a dedicated server, and by the way they do have deals for that, but you have to ask for them from support. Sometimes they take a long time to answer."

I'm always a fella with the Motto ""You get what you pay for"" with VPS6 I expected to have a VPS that was reasonable, but nothing spectacular for $10 per month. Well I stand corrected once again! They're running some very nify hardware on these nodes for the price you're paying. As I mentioned above, you're getting some nifty hardware for the price, which would instantly make me think ""oversold"", but no! They really aren't, I'm seeing consistent speeds 24x7 across my VPS's along with fast performance from those disks (RAID-16 SAS?). I can't complain for $10 I must say. Their USA networks are brilliant. Great speeds along with a very nice uptime to go with it. In Romania and Turkey I've faced a few outages but they've been resolved quickly.

BHost,www.bhost.net,J. van Heugten,"Wednesday, January 9, 2013","I ordered a new VPS five days ago. The VPS was set up in minutes and showed up in the VPS manager. I chose an image to install (Debian 6 netinstall) and it was ready after about a minute. No complaints so far. However the VPS IP was unreachable (no ping replies). I first thought it was because I selected a 64 bit image and maybe the server was only capable of 32 bit? However installing a 32 bit version did not resolve the problem. Java Console wasn't working either, so I picked the IP of the console and started a SSH session to that IP.  So I finally got into the VPS. First action was to check the networking/interface settings and routes. Those seemed totally normal. Pinging to the outside did however work, but not to anywhere outside the BHost network. This is a serious routing/firewall issue it appears. I created a ticket. Of course I ordered on Friday evening, so I had to wait till Monday for a reply (which is acceptable for the price I am paying). However their reply was just ""We are investigating it"". Tuesday evening, still unreachable, no new reply from support. Conclusion: BHost is nice for testing/development purposes, but I don't suggest hosting anything for real there."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Leo Ponton,"Friday, December 28, 2012","So far so good. A huge learning curve for me, but the VPS from BHost does what it says. Setup after purchase was less than ten seconds, pings are less than 30ms. At the price I'm not expecting a bullet-proof service or 24/7 instant response, you get what you pay for. The one ticket I opened was dealt with in three days, but it was not an urgent issue and it was Christmas. If you need something solid with instant tech support, look elsewhere and pay accordingly. If you are happy with the potential risks and realistic about what to expect for your money then this one is very difficult to beat."

I prefer the predictability of Xen over openVZ and it's not so easy to find a decent Xen provider in the UK because openVZ is cheaper. All I can say is that I am now moving a portion of my personal sites that need a UK base over to bhost as the testing I have done just points to nothing but a quality and friendly service. 5 stars all the way, keep up the good work folks!"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Aaron Jackson,"Wednesday, July 4, 2012",Very decent VPS hosting at a very low price. The support is relatively fast and polite which is a surprise when you consider how cheap they are.
BHost,www.bhost.net,Julian Knight,"Tuesday, July 3, 2012","It was a great and pleasant surprise to find a UK based VPS at a price to rival a US based Shared Host. BHost continue to surprise with an amazingly reliable service. Even better, I can't tell that there is anyone else sharing the server, performance is always top notch. The only minor thing to note is that they purely focus on the delivery of the VPS itself, no bells and whistles like DNS and no extensive help files like Linode."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Russ Murch,"Monday, July 2, 2012","Very happy with the hosting solution. Everything I need and helpful people who can talk in non-techy terms, but seem to have a full grasp of my requirements each time we communicate."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Blaine Nixon,"Monday, June 25, 2012","It was odd coming from my previous host who had a dedicated DNS for you, but the support ticket's at BHost are answered quickly, they don't charge you for ""services rendered"" (i.e changing your service plan to something you're already paying for or to activate a feature) and you can't beat the deals they give you. Also, the VPS online client is great for emergency fixes, and the benefit of sign your usage per month from the pannel is great! Although being able to choose your own username would be a plus, I've memorized the one they gave me already."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Alex,"Friday, June 22, 2012",I've been using bHost for a year now and they are simply fantastic. Best customer service I've ever seen and awesome priced boxes. I recommend them to everyone I know. 
BHost,www.bhost.net,Danny Gee,"Friday, June 8, 2012",I have used BHost for many years and I am pleased to say that I am extremely satisfied with their level of customer service and of their pricing structure. 
BHost,www.bhost.net,Bart De Vos,"Thursday, June 7, 2012","Awesome, quick support! Very reliable host, after 8 months, 0 downtime."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Manoj,"Monday, June 4, 2012","Impressive.Pros:* Simple interface to deploy and manage the VPS.* Super value for money.* Cannot comment on downtime yet, but I haven't had any problems till date.* Good choice of OS images for deployment.Cons:* Support isn't very quick. You may have to wait for a few hours (1-2) before you get a resolution.You are on your own. I'd not suggest them for newbies. That said, if you have a fair exposure in working with a linux system, you can manage."
BHost,www.bhost.net,David James Mays,"Thursday, May 31, 2012",Easy to set up. Very helpful and very rapid customer support. Very good value for money. Would highly recommend to both personal and small business users!
BHost,www.bhost.net,Lawrie Goodwin,"Sunday, May 27, 2012",Very good value for a UK provider and excellent reliability. Any issues are always communicated quickly via Twitter and customers are kept updated. I've taken a long time to find a provider who has got the balance right between cost and quality and I think BHost have succeeded.
BHost,www.bhost.net,Darren,"Friday, May 25, 2012","Incredibly cheap hosting, and I haven't experienced any server issues so far.  Also, the customer service has proven to be prompt and friendly."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Kean,"Saturday, May 19, 2012","This is one of the cheapest and reliable servers I have had. Never had any major issues and when it did go down it was back up rapidly. The live chat on the site is so good to get quick and easy support. Good services, amazing prices & support. I would recommend anyone here. "
BHost,www.bhost.net,Alexander,"Friday, May 11, 2012","I have been using this provider for several months and I am fully satisfied with it. The customer service is fast and productive. I've had a problem at the beginning of our partnership, and it was solved very quickly. Also they have a wiki, that was useful for me. The price is great, it would cost me twice the money or more for the same vps in my country. I won't be lying, there were minor periods, when the service was offline for me. But the company always posted about the problems in the twitter and I wasn't in a panic, that I did something wrong. It was fixed very quickly, so it isn't a problem for me. My general impression is really great. This company fully satisfies my needs plus more. The RAM burst is very useful and really working. I wish that they will be online for many more years."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Brandon Bradley,"Friday, May 11, 2012",I'm in their Xen service it has been solid!

BHost,www.bhost.net,Maff,"Tuesday, April 3, 2012","Absolutely fantastic service. Excellent stability, brilliant pricing, almost 100% uptime - the only (short) outages I've experienced have been dealt with quickly and professionally.

BHost,www.bhost.net,Jenni Phillips,"Wednesday, March 21, 2012","Like several others on here I was a bit sceptical at the low price, however so far I've been plesantly surprised.  Been with them around 5 months and the only issues I have had have been my own creation, and the rare time's I've need to use their support its been quick and quality."

BHost,www.bhost.net,Angus,"Tuesday, March 6, 2012","BHost is a superb VPS supplier, offering great value for money against fantastic service.In looking for low cost solutions, I've come across a fair number of poor services at this cost, and so was rather sceptical when signing up. However, I'm incredibly satisfied by BHost, and have even purchased multiple servers from them.I would most definitely recommend them."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Kyros Koh,"Monday, March 5, 2012","I had been with BHost for not too long, just for within a month or so. Hopefully will continue their services. Their response time is excellence. Their network speed is highly above average compared to other providers and its latency back to Singapore is quite a minimal. Would highly recommend to everyone else!"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Ollie,"Monday, March 5, 2012","I have never been with a host that gives me such low prices, and yet such a HIGH level of service in every way in my 12 year on the web."

BHost,www.bhost.net,Jayesh,"Sunday, March 4, 2012","BHost have provided an excellent service for near on two years now. Not only are they incredibly cheap, but their support has been quick and informative and they have always been able to accommodate my requests."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Tony Bronze,"Sunday, March 4, 2012","Have had a VPS with BHosts for just over a year and can only say it has been faultless.  Never intended to use it as a production server, more as a learning and testing environment but it has been more stable and reliable than managed hosting I have elsewhere.Great company to deal with and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Josh,"Thursday, March 1, 2012","Can't fault them in the slightest - I've got two instances there and everything has been brilliant for the past few months. No service issues, and excellent support response in the unlikely event you need some help. Can't recommend them highly enough!"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Jamie Dunbar,"Monday, February 27, 2012","I used to be with bHost and for some reason left, tempted by another deal elsewhere.  The temptress was good, and keen to impress but in the end bhost were half the price and have faster servers.  I love the regular updates on Twitter, they are reassuring in this world on one man VPS companies.  Keep up the good work Bhost! I am excited about Xen rumours too!"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Rob Hall,"Saturday, February 25, 2012","After reading loads of reviews of VPS Hosting companies I decided to take advantage of a special offer and went with Bhost. I can honestly say that they have been excellent to deal with. Support calls answered in a decent time, no problems so far and an easy to use interface. A very happy bunny and I will certainly be using them for further projects I have in the pipeline."

BHost,www.bhost.net,Sam Crawford,"Sunday, February 19, 2012","I've only been with BHost a short time, but so far the service has been excellent. <10 minute response times to support tickets on a Sunday, instantaneous setup, and fantastic pricing."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Laurie Mustafic,"Wednesday, February 15, 2012","Amazing value. You only need to compare Bhost's prices  to a few other companies to realise the value they are offering. On top of that, class A customer service. For a few quid a month without a contract, it's worth a punt and it's a pretty safe assumption that you won't want to stop paying."
BHost,www.bhost.net,James Aubury,"Tuesday, February 14, 2012","Have been using them for over a year now and cant fault them. Very helpful, fast responses to inquires, and very solid platform.Keep it up BHost!"
BHost,www.bhost.net,Pat,"Tuesday, February 14, 2012","Having been with other VPS providers, i opened with Bhost after experiencing many issues with my previous supplier - I wish i had found Bhost before now as they are brilliant! - not one single issue to date on on my VPS, and setup was immediate.  Their prices are VERY keenly priced and you will be hard pushed to find a better combination of price/service and quality anywhere else!"

BHost,www.bhost.net,David Carson,"Wednesday, December 14, 2011",Moving from a hosted solution to a VPS was something I was apprehensive about but I have to say that the BHost service is absolutely superb. I've experienced very few issues and and problems I did have (mainly of my own making) were resolved quickly and efficiently - even on a Sunday evening. Add that to the low cost and it is fantastic value for money.
BHost,www.bhost.net,Ciaran,"Tuesday, December 13, 2011",Very good service. Would recommend to anyone. Very fast service with no downtime unless previously scheduled.
BHost,www.bhost.net,Jose Guedes,"Tuesday, December 13, 2011","Great VPS Provider, They have a good Customer Service, An affordable service and good quality on it.

BHost,www.bhost.net,Evangelos Tripolitakis,"Monday, December 12, 2011","I purchased a VPS from BHost about two months ago. Everything runs smoothly and the hardware is premium.

BHost,www.bhost.net,Paul Stanyer,"Sunday, December 11, 2011","I started using BHost in May, and I've not had a single problem, so difficult to say what customer service is like. All I can go by is the sales experience, which was quick & simple, if not pretty.I was moving from an old shared hosting account which was costing me more, and offering me not only less flexibility but generally much less bandwidth/hardware.Everything was set-up and ready to start playing with within minutes of me making my order, and there was a great choice of images to start with.Have since recommended them to 3 friends and they have all had the same fantastic experience. For the money you really can't go wrong."
BHost,www.bhost.net,John Quixote,"Saturday, December 10, 2011","From day one I have had 100% value for money, but most important first class customer service.

They do some cracking deals and are happy to negotiate with existing clients!
BHost,www.bhost.net,Paul G,"Saturday, December 10, 2011",Apart from customers support  which is extremely slow on reaction and sometimes helpless they are great! good value for money.
BHost,www.bhost.net,David Fahed,"Saturday, December 10, 2011",I tried their services for 1 month. It was an excellent services but I didn't succeed to configure my proxy to watch BBC outside England. But nothing to say about the services (bandwidth...).
BHost,www.bhost.net,Tom,"Saturday, December 10, 2011","By far the best VPS provider I've come across, proactive support and available 24/7- genuinely: I raised an issue at 3am and had a response by 3:15! No problems at all with the products- I have two VPS with these guys-  both have 100% uptime (excluding when I've broken them!!). Being able to request automated rebuilds of servers is fantastic, as any 'mess-ups' I make are easily fixed! "

BHost,www.bhost.net,Timm,"Friday, December 9, 2011","They changed their Terms of Service with no warning or grace period. >Our new Terms and Conditions, which come into effect immediately, can be viewed at.... ....>BitTorrent services or BitTorrent-related services. This includes, but is not limited to: ""Torrent clients,"" ""Torrent trackers,"" and hosting, storing or transferring ""Torrent files.""BitTorrent is just a program that can have legitimate uses.  Even considering illegal file sharing,  you can just as easily host infringing material as normal web content.   Most providers take the more reasonable stance of saying 'no illegal content'.While I accept that Bhost has the right to change their TOS, giving no warning is unprofessional."
BHost,www.bhost.net,Andy,"Monday, December 5, 2011","Ordered a new vps (silver) from them today.

TransIP,www.transip.eu,A. Shen,"Tuesday, April 26, 2016","TransIP has a very good pricing for the Virtual Private Services! It is not the cheapest, but if thats what you want, there are plenty of others.My experience with TransIP is that they have let me acces my VPS within 1 hour after sign up. They always reply technical e-mail requests within 10 hours (although they say: within 24 hrs)."
TransIP,www.transip.eu,Tomasz,"Wednesday, December 9, 2015",I was very cautious about migrating our servers to another provider. Currently we have one test server with TransIP and moving our websites selectively.  So far I'm positive about this company. Quality service and support. Good response time.
TransIP,www.transip.eu,Andy Jones,"Friday, July 24, 2015",i signed up to try out there free month x4 vps today i found there support is none existent there vps deployment is complete rubbish. They use a graphical interface to setup the os to which you cannot see the buttons to go to the next stage of the setup. I was testing vps companies as in th future i was hoping to move from my current vps provider but have now decided to stay where i am i would avoid this company at all costs there not s cheap as people say on here and he big alarm bells to me is the lack of ways of contactng them the only way is tickets to which are a waste of time not even an answer on sales questions nor on technical support.My current providers support is sketchy but at least i get an answer within 20 mins. I am experienced with unmanaged vps's and have been with my current provider for over 7 years on and off but transip is way to buggy for me. 
TransIP,www.transip.eu,Mihail Paskalev,"Wednesday, May 20, 2015",Very loyal and professional team.I recommend TransIP !
TransIP,www.transip.eu,Abhishek Dwivedi,"Thursday, April 23, 2015","I will highly recommend the service of TransIP. Of course I got a good deal for my domains, but that is not the only factor. Their customer support is impressive! I had some questions regarding my domains and they followed-up (I think almost 20 mails or so) and even during the weekend until it was not resolved.Moreover the user interface for managing the domain and related attributes is clean and simple.In short, highly recommended!"
TransIP,www.transip.eu,Samih,"Monday, April 13, 2015","TransIP sure is a really good company to purchase a VPS with as it is quite cheap compared to many companies out there. But I would not say I am the happiest customer, a few years ago I purchased a domain and I was no longer using this domain so I did not want to renew it. What happened was, I got emails saying domain needs to be reviewed and suddenly I see them sending me an invoice saying that THEY renewed my domain.It is really disappointing when you aren't aware domains renew automatically. I don't know why they bother sending emails telling me my domain needs to be renewed. Basically got Legally Scammed.Sure,  I'll continue to be their customer but new customers should watch out, make sure you cancel whatever service you have if you do not want to pay for it."

This is all I need, as well as most of the customers (IMHO). I have migrated to TransIP from one of the most famous VPS provider and I have no regrets!"
TransIP,www.transip.eu,MB,"Monday, October 21, 2013","I found TransIP while searching the web for VPS providers located in the Europe region. I initially found their Dutch site: transip.nl and took a look at their VPS plans. The site was in Dutch but I was able to make out what their offers were and I found them to be very well priced for the specifications. They were having a promotion on the BladeVPS line of VPS where the first month was half price, this was a positive point. After a little searching, I found the English language site at transip.eu. They were having the same promotion at this site as well so I decided to order a BladeVPS X4 for 10 EUR the first month and 20 EUR therafter. The order process was smooth and easy. There was a point where they carried out phone verification, they had me enter a phone number and gave me a secret number to enter in when called. This initially surprised me as I do not encounter phone verifications very often (I live in North America). The phone verification was straight-forward with no difficulties. I entered in my billing details and the payment was quickly processed. I received email confirmation which told me that my server would be set up immediately. According to the timestamp on my emails, my order was accepted at 1202 and my server was provisioned by 1207pm. It only took 5 minutes. I am very happy with this. My operating system of choice is FreeBSD. This OS is provided by TransIP and I am pleased to say that every aspect of the installation process can be customized. TransIP provides VNC console access through the control panel from which the OS installation process can be carried out. When choosing FreeBSD as the OS, the ISO for the OS is mounted and the VPS is booted into the ISO. I expect it will be similar for other OS. This means that the OS installation is carried out by the user. For novice users this may be a challenging task, but for the experienced user it is routine. There are some VPS providers who do not provide this flexibility, they will just install the OS for you and will not allow you to carry out a custom installation, they will refuse to boot your system into the installation ISO. Carrying out a custom installation requires some familiarity with the OS. Having this flexibility is a major positive point with me. I have been with TransIP for two months now and I can say that I am happy with the service. There has been one occurrence where the VPS lost network connectivity and I had to restart networking on the VPS. I brought this up with TransIP and they carried out investigation to pinpoint the cause. They reported that there seemed to be nothing wrong on their end and advised me to contact them if I experience this issue again. This is a minor inconvenience which has only occurred once. In summary, TransIP is a quality VPS provider that provides flexibility. I recommend TransIP."

I then found TransIP hosting, and I decided to go for their offer of Blade VPS with CPU: 4 cores, RAM: 8192 MB, Hard disk: 300 GB. I am glad I did this choice, as this hosting is  both fast and stable, and the support is real fast as well! As for the speed of delivery of the hosting, ready to go, I never have seen something this automated and effective and fast. Few minutes after I order online, my hosting was up and ready to go!

I must say I was really impressed by the whole installation process. After ordering, my vps was delivered in seconds. To date everything still runs fine.

Seriously. Its that fast most of the time. We host over 90 websites on their Managed VPS and have had no real issues. We have clients with other hosting companies (not by choice) and their sites are always slower to load and under perform. We do mostly Wordpress sites, so speed is important.

HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Christopher Malkin,"Wednesday, February 11, 2015","I must say after switching to Hostforweb I have never been happier with my hosting. This is just awesome! Since the time I switched over to Hostforweb I have had no problems at all. Knowing that I can access this level of technical support, I am very pleased to have chosen their hosting service over the competition.So far The uptime has been better then they say it is and I've had nothing but the best technical support from them.I just wanted to submit this review hoping other people who are in the same position I was in awhile ago will find it and know where to go for good quality hosting."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Andy Loicest,"Thursday, February 5, 2015","No long history with these folks yet however I must make these observations because fair is fair: I and some others were forced to change hosts due to our host went out of business. I went with Hostforweb based on the number of positive reviews from users. Hostforweb reliability and support have been flawless. I have not had a single issue.  Immediate account setup and I had a number of questions that I sent via email and they were answered precisely, accurately, logically and in easy to understand terms in less than 15 minutes every time. So far everything is good...if it changes I will post again but for now I and my 8 customers in the USA are happy."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Rick Memendes,"Wednesday, January 28, 2015","Amazing. Would recommend these guys to anyone. As a small web design company our last hosts caused us no end of grief, but they've been brilliant - easy to set up. They have great customer support. I had a couple of questions during the initial setup, I received very quick and informative responses from the staff at Hostforweb, inc.I love the prices. The server was down for about 15 minutes one month. That's pretty good up time!As far as the up-time. It is very good. I have monitoring software for keeping up-time statistics and so far the up-time is unparralled.I am very happy with their support and i do recommend them for anyone who looks for the best web hosting provider."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Rich Hatton,"Tuesday, January 20, 2015","I have been running my wordpress blogs (3 blogs) with Hostforweb for about 4 months. They offered 30% off the price coupon code in the beginning of Autumn, 2014 - I decided to catch that opportunity and saved good sum of money for my future project. BTW, their customer support was very helpful in transferring my files (blogs) to their web servers. I also got Private SSL and 1-year Domain Registration for free.They have manage to keep my site running smoothly even when it has grown 5 times bigger than it was with the previous hosts and, I must say, always with excellent service and response times.Their plans' capacity might not be amazingly huge, but it's reasonable and fair. I recommend this web host, at least I know that my website hosting is secured for years to come!"
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Joe S.,"Tuesday, November 18, 2014","Nice people, decent service plans, cheap cost, but it just isn't worth the continual headache of your site being down and your email bouncing (sent and received). I was a customer for about 7 years and have a lot of technical knowledge (I write software and build websites) and they just weren't up to basic business standards. My sites would be down for hours at a time. The best thing I ever did was switch to a better host."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Ricky Morrington,"Tuesday, November 11, 2014","Hostforweb rocks, because they helped me with my issue I had with my emails. To be honest I did not expected to get answer from them so fast. I waited for about 15 minutes.In a few words I have to say they are great provider. My site as well as my emails is very fast. Support works very fast as well.  So, taking into the account their price I have to say that Im working with one of the best providers.Keep such a good service!"
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Pedro Suares,"Wednesday, September 17, 2014","I switched to Hostforweb after a bad experience with another host. I paid via paypal, everything went ok. They have several affordable packages and have generally been very good to me. No downtime, speedy connection.Everytime I got some questions, I ask them online, no waiting times, there is always some one waiting there online to help us, it's just amazing. Good support information including knowledgebase and regularly updated system status. Their plans are quite cheap when you figure what you're getting for them.I really recommend this company. I am planning to use their reseller package for a long long time. "
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Pavel Veleba,"Wednesday, August 13, 2014","I found Hostforweb to be very helpful and competent in answering any questions or making changed to my site. Admittedly I am only hosting html based site, but have a steady flow of visitors, who extremely rarely report downtime.I use them for my web and email hosting and they have been very reliable with nearly no downtime since we've been using them. This service allows for easy setup of websites and emails, modifications, and monitoring through their control panel user page. Online explanations of features and instructions are clearly written.Very Good Uptime, Great Support, Good Features. No major problems. Very professional staff."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Gab Thomps,"Wednesday, June 4, 2014","Can express the point that Hostforweb is awesome, the support is professional when they aren't being asked any newbie's questions. The price can't be beat, the Control Panel is really easy to use. The site has always powered my web site with ease, no matter how much burst in traffic i get, it still runs very fast. Uptime since I moved has been 100% and the server is always fast and stable. It may be $12.95/month for business pro plan, but for this kind of service, i will gladly pay it. My site it ultra-fast these days and I'm a very happy customer. Back to my experience with Hostforweb for last couple months - I would say you can rely on it. "
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Bacteria Knight,"Wednesday, November 20, 2013","After browsing all the hosts available on the net, Hostforweb seemed to have the best prices for the best services. So, I decided to give them a try. I'm so satisfied with this host, my business now has grown rapidly, I have a different hosting accounts with Hostforweb, and everything continues to be smooth. For any help or issues I have, I can count on their willingness to go the extra mile just to ensure I'm happy. Site is extremely fast to load and has had almost perfect uptime. The features they offer are nearly endless, and their customer support is simply outstanding. 9 out of 10 is my final rating of this web host. "
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Chuck23,"Monday, August 19, 2013","I've been with hostforweb for 3 months and a half - I would like to say that I am fully satisfied dealing with them.Their support impressed me. When I talked to one of their experts from support team, I had no feeling from him of wanting to fix my problem as quickly as he could so he could move on the next customer; instead, he made sure he completely understood the issue I was having and did everything he could to fix it, which he did. He also explained what the issue was in a way I could understand. It was my mistake. As for the speed connectivity, it is quite good. My pages upload very fast. Their script installer tool is useful.They have normal pricing and their discounts passed on the savings to me.Performance is great. Recommended. "
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Nickolas Hewit,"Thursday, July 18, 2013","I began using Hostforweb in 2011, I have been going on and off with various domains throughout the years with them and have experienced good service. Sign-up was a snap and I immediately began transferring my Websites. The customer service is fantastic. You can contact them about anything. It doesn't have to be a problem. Even general inquiries are happily and quickly addressed. I mean quick, too; often within minutes. I was pleasantly surprised by the backup tools you provide which I did not expect at all. They get an A for running their business with a good product and unmatched customer support."
HostForWeb,www.hostforweb.com,Nancy C. Evers,"Wednesday, June 26, 2013","I have been with HostForWeb not so long but I would like to say that I am very satisfied running my site with them. I have no outages and downtime. The set-up was fast - I was transferring my test sites within minutes of receiving their instant welcome emails. I can say that they are very helpful in transferring files. They run specials and it is a great plus for them. I've not had one minute of downtime so I am very pleased, and to top everything off their servers are not crowded and they don't oversell so their server speeds are second to none (very fast). Overall, I would recommend HostForWeb to experienced and new users."

You are not just a number or a monthly payment to these people; you are a part of a huge hosting family. Since their growth, they have not lost this charm at all.The staff members are absolutely amazing. To be specific, James and Steve have went over and above for me over the years. Most support tickets are not only answered, but resolved within the hour!Whether you are a beginner or highly tech-savvy, they will make it a point to offer to walk you though anything you need, and even offer to do certain things for you. Long-time customers are definitely acknowledged and are constantly appreciated. You will be well taken care of.I will forever be a Webhostpython customer for as long as they will have me! If you are questioning joining the family, question no more; just do it! Prices are great, value is high, and support is on your side."

They act quickly, and teach you how to fix and fine tune.;  James even gives his home phone and is available for immediate problems, and the tech support staff is extremely responsive and ready to help...  I give it a 5 star rating.  I have many websites, and have many problems, they tell me how to fix and in most cases they fix it for me...  The best hosting experience I have ever had!!!  "

Webhostpython,www.webhostpython.com,John Hensley,"Friday, October 17, 2014","I've been a customer for about two years now.  Prior to becoming a customer, I went through several different hosting companies and left for one reason or another.  When I first found them, I had many conversations with James and then I became a customer and thought, ""I bet the support/service won't be as quick"".  After all, doesn't that happen most of the time?  Prior to the sale, great and speedy responses, then once you become a customer, then its difficult at best to have even a simple question answered.  Well, I'm here to tell you, the support and service is simply over the top, world class support and service.  James and his team even helps out for things that I should have done, without complaint, just great customer service.  If you are in need of an outstanding hosting provider, you certainly will not find any better."
Webhostpython,www.webhostpython.com,Divraj Sohal,"Wednesday, September 24, 2014","I am writing this because whole Team of Webhostpython especially James and Steve deserves a pat on their back for not only providing such great Services & Support but for also being such Noble human beings which are difficult to find in today's world. I was having too many issues with my site speed and each hosting company i contacted were unable to guide me or suggest me and Even the big hosting companies to name a few (hostgator, inmotionhosting, siteground & many more) were only after making money and only suggested the biggest plans without even observing the website.. I was confused on many issues and all those companies were not able to provide the required information which was needed for my site and hosting... Then to my Luck and with God's grace i came across Webhostpython.com.. James the person whom i first talked to was able to provide all the information i needed and even went through my whole website without any questions... I was ready to opt for the Plan which was more expensive ( as i was misguided by big hosting companies to opt for only big plans) , but James suggested me that i dont need to spend so much Money when i can get all the resources at much Lower Price.. Well Thanks to James again for being honest and truthful and not opting for money rather opting for quality and service and suggesting me and helping me choose the right plan and even gave me the discount and guarantee which Big Companies failed to provide... So now i m running two sites on their Hosting and all my issues have been resolved.. Live Support, Service, Speed and Uptime is awesome and more staisfying than one can think of... So thanks to Webhostpython, looking forward to be with you guys for whole of my Life...."

Webhostpython,www.webhostpython.com,Jay,"Tuesday, May 27, 2014","I can't think of a greater company to host my site with. Their service is simply outstanding. You'll never achieve 100% uptime no matter where you go, also due to things your hosting company has no influence on (although their 99.99% uptime guarantee is not just sales speech), but what I like the most is that in the very rare circumstances when something isn't right their service is extremely fast, reliable and professional. And that's very hard to find. Their IT guru Steve is a true gem. And the one time he made a mistake (just because he was overly protective and rebooted my server in vain as he suspected a hacker attack which lead to my site's being down for seconds) he was completely honest instead of telling a lie (which he completely could have done as he knows I'm not a geek). Furthermore they never tried to sell me anything I didn't need at that time (even when I specifically asked for it). Long story short, they're highly professional, absolutely honest and very reasonably priced."

I been with Webhostpython for few months now and had to find a place to give a review because they really deserve it. They've done everything to get me right and have taken care of me. They've even helped with things outside hosting like ordering business cards, setting up emails. I love the support. I've kept the team on the phone for hours, and felt bad about it. But they always let me know it's OK. For all of their hardwork, and commitment, they deserve this. I give them A. "

Hosting has been hard work, less than satisfying, expensive, and in some cases unsafe. I need a neat and clean set up,  good customer service, and a professional looking site.

I decided to subscribe to their Webmaster Plan, which roughly costs around $20 a month, and so far, I am very satisfied with their service.

I was recommended to Rivalhost and thought I would give them a go with one of my domains. Best decision I ever made. Not only is the service extremely affordable for the space and size, but the customer service makes it all worthwhile. Fantastic company, highly recommend!"
Rivalhost,www.rivalhost.com,Jenn A,"Friday, October 11, 2013","Due to the fact that I had no real prior experience with website hosting and the fact I had 4 websites I decided to purchase the Professional Package from Rivalhost based on a close friends recommendation. Rivalhost provided me with exactly what I was looking for. Everything was set up fast, my questions were answered quickly and there was always help available around the clock. My sites are up and running and I couldnt ask for them to be managed better. The service is excellent and affordable. Thanks Rivalhost. I will recommend you to everyone."
Rivalhost,www.rivalhost.com,nelson,"Friday, October 11, 2013","Hosting websites has never been that easy. Different plans are either too expensive or have a very data throughput.

Rivalhost,www.rivalhost.com,Caitlyn,"Friday, October 11, 2013",I came across Rivalhost when I was looking for a web hosting site for my beauty blog. I tried out their $1 - 24 hour trial and knew within a few hours that they were the ones I wanted to host my site. I also got my email hosted through them as well which has helped me track my business via my cell phone without having to download several apps. I was able to sync my contacts and share my calendar with all of my staff in just a few clicks. I am loving Rivalhost so far and look forward to using their business for many years.

Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Eric G.,"Tuesday, June 10, 2014","I have been working in the Web Development Business for over 15 years. Throughout that time I have experienced many Hosting Services. NONE of them can compare to Osiris. They have always answered my calls. They have gone above and beyond to answering my questions, and simply having excellent customer relations! Their services are just as good as the huge companies (and I argue, even better), and I don't have to be put on hold for almost an hour to have a conversation about my SSL certificate. Any time a client of mine is not satisfied with their hosting service, I always refer to Osiris. THEY ARE THE BEST! Remember, I've been in this business since the beginning of the WWW!"
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Brent Hamby,"Monday, June 9, 2014","We used Osiris to launch NextDB.net where we had our own hardware and hosted it in the Osiris facility.  We received great support from Osiris which went above and beyond our expectations.  Overall we found them them to be very response and professional, as well as very reasonably priced.  I would highly recommend these guys."
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Mark Phillips,"Monday, June 9, 2014","My small company has been with Osiris for many years, over a decade I think.  We rely on them for both VPS and colo services.  In all that time we have a perfect 100% uptime record.  Their customer service is super fast and they've repeatedly worked with us to custom tailor exactly what we need, down to super-specific firewall and port forwarding configurations.  They've repeatedly worked with me to help design efficient technical solutions to the oddball problems I've brought to them.  Their rates are excellent.  They've even intervened to help me get into the colo building at odd hours when I was completely baffled by construction which had closed the main entrance.  Very highly recommended."
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Darrell Esau,"Monday, June 9, 2014","I've been using Osiris for 7 years now (started in June 2007).  I've never once had a problem with the quality of service or support.  I run a small business and use Osiris for Colocation.  The location is great, network speed is fantastic, and facilities are always clean and working nicely.  The support (any time of the day and week) has always been very responsive and very helpful.  I highly recommend Osiris to everyone that's looking for quality colocation services at very good pricing."
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Richard Deering,"Wednesday, May 28, 2014","Our organization decided to downgrade from running our own equipment to a 3rd party hosted solution. Based on a recommendation, we choose Osiris as our hosting provider. Osiris has definitely lived up to the promises they initially made, and probably over delivered a few times as well. Definitely worth the investment to make the switch."
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Jeremy Osborne,"Tuesday, April 22, 2014","I was referred to this company by a friend. Distinct from other hosting services that I've used in the past, Osiris provided great and personalized technical support. When I ran into problems that were my own fault, as well as those not my fault, I was able to get a response and get the problem solved in short order. It's pleasant in this day and age to find personality behind the technology. And, of course, the hosting was solid."
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Terry Wood,"Wednesday, April 16, 2014","We moved our application from another provider that simply couldn't provide the level of support we required. Osiris has been extremely helpful and consultative. Their service meets their tag line, like a Rock. "
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Patrick Sculley,"Monday, January 20, 2014","Osiris has been with us right from the start. Their expertise goes beyond hosting, providing architecture, design and systems support. By using Osiris, we can leverage a combination of co-located, hosted and cloud burst services.

Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Patrik Ahlin,"Friday, January 17, 2014",We have been with Osiris Communications since the very beginning. That makes it almost 15 years.  They have been there every time we have needed assistance including on Christmas Eve into the middle of the night and the early morning hours.  Support is superb! I can not put into words how much Osiris Communications have helped our business grow and stay on top of it all. Absolutely the best!
Osiris Communications,www.osiriscomm.com,Peter S.,"Wednesday, January 15, 2014","We have been with Osiris Communications for more than a decade and still consider it to be one of our best decisions. We have multiple domains, and over the years, Osiris has provided a fast and stable network for our servers, as well as clean and reliable email hosting.  After ages of managing our own hardware, email and DNS, we were a little anxious about switching gears, but Osiris made it painless and easy. A big shout out to their tech guys who took the time to explain anything we asked about. An incredible amount of knowledge on that team. We are able to have dedicated hardware where it is needed, and we have been able to offload most of our operations to Osiris' VPS solutions which saves time, eliminates a lot of maintenance headaches, and is amazingly cost effective. We might change a lot of things in my organization, but the one thing we won't be changing is our network provider."
RapidVPS,www.RapidVPS.com,Stephen Medd,"Wednesday, February 5, 2014","Their VPS service was very poor, their middle grade VPS often had times running a single low volume website with a low volume TeamSpeak server on it half of the time. TeamSpeak constantly had massive lag spikes, the website often had load time issues. As a result of my complaints we were often moved from server to server. Every new server would be good for a month or two and then it would start the same thing. The cause was always extremely high resource usage during the day on the entire server showing that they overload their servers.On top of the poor service I have been with them for 2 years (had a 2 year plan), however when I tried to leave them I ran into issues. They told me I could not cancel my service because I have not given them enough notice and that they would send my bill to collections if I decided not to pay. That was their first response, didnt bother asking why I was leaving or if they could do anything better, just that if I dont pay they will send me to collections. I did manage to work something out but it required me still paying them a decent sum of money.The only recommendation I can give is to stay away."
RapidVPS,www.RapidVPS.com,Nick Barry,"Monday, November 4, 2013","We have been doing business with Rapid VPS since 2008.  We started with their VPS package, and upgraded that a couple times before moving to a dedicated server for our websites.  The Rapid VPS team has always worked hard to support our migrations and support needs.  The price is great for the server you get, but it is not the cheapest out there.  But the support is fast and great (although they have tried out-sourcing their support which is a huge negative in my opinion, not sure if it is all internal again or not).  They also advertise 24/7 support, which in the past year or so I've found is not 24/7, as our service has gone down with no one to get a hold of.  Hopefully they have realized that and made an adjustment.  This host provider does have occasional down time and mishaps/mistakes.  It is hard to be perfect, but they do at least seem to care, and you can get to know the owners themselves, who run the business themselves, which is a plus in my book."

Had many examples of great experiences.  Top notch support.  And has always been on top of their game when it comes to the servers.  I recommend them anytime i can. Being able to reach a company by phone and email has worked out great, if I'm on the road, traveling, or sitting at my pc, i know i an 1 step away from having access to a live person to help me with anything i need. I could go on and on, but they are by far the best company i've been with in years.  And i've tried many hosting company's before i found them, and haven't looked back since."

I currently operate 15 websites on a dedicated server and 3 websites on a virtual private server. I also send between 500,000 & 1 million emails per day. In other words, my operation requires a lot of TLC which I get at RapidVPS. The technical side has been great and the customer service very responsive.  If you're looking for very reliable web hosting and responsive  customer support I highly recommend RapidVPS."

ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Kalinowski,"Monday, November 24, 2014","I have been with ViUX hosting for roughly 2-3 months. I signed up with their Xpress package, which provides ample resources for wordpress. If you have experience with wordpress you should know that not every webhosting provider could handle wordpress requirements, especially if you are going to use plugins, and I believe you would do that. However even lowest plan from ViUX perfectly suitable to deal with wordpress and proved reliability to me trough my experience with them. They are using cloud environment so I have available resources and high stability for all the time. I must say that control panel is unusual, but useful and you can get used to it. Whenever there was any question, their support responded within minutes and assisted in a highly professional manner. I know that I am using them not for very long to render the whole picture, but till now I am pleased. "
ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Famard,"Wednesday, July 9, 2014","No words can express my feelings from using ViUX cloud hosting service. They have outstanding deals. When I need a support I got fast and professional assistance from my support manager, do they ever sleep? They interact in a truly polite manner. For only $3 I get enough space for all my projects and databases, unlimited traffic and some extras, like one-click installer. Stability is received as promised - 99.99%, and this shows how trustworthy ViUX hosting is. My websites are working smoothly. As an addition they have really useful tool for file sharing, now with it dropbox is useless indeed. If you ask me what I don't like from them, I won't remember a thing. ViUX is always ready to go extra mile for their customers."
ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Hanz,"Wednesday, March 12, 2014","I'm not sure if they are the best, but after a couple of lemons I've been with, I signed up with ViUX.com as I needed a good Drupal host. After switching, I've had virtually no problems as far as uptime or tech support. ViUX makes it really easy to set up your website with their one-click installs in Plesk control panel, which even beginners can understand easily. The service has been excellent and is a great value for the money. The support is really responsive. Whenever I contact them I get a fast reply in a professional manner. They have done a perfect job helping me with any issue or question I've had. Network speed is very fast with my site loading in seconds and server uptime is high, I think that is because of cloud environment. Just want to show my appreciation to ViUX Hosting for their killer services."
ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Doc,"Friday, December 6, 2013","Over the past eleven years I've had 14 different hosting providers and none of them really shined.  That was until I found ViUX.  These guys are incredible and helped me out with a configuration everyone else didn't want to even attempt. I truly feel that my association with ViUX will allow our company to grow faster than ever before because our business clientele is more demanding now, we can meet their demands."
ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Luke Lichterman,"Tuesday, November 19, 2013","I recently had a self-inflicted cyber-wound in my website structure, which appeared to be FAR beyond my primitive ability to repair. I contacted Viux about what I had done and I received intense personal service from a senior member of the Viux Management Team, J.T.S. J.T. told me how to fix my site, saving me untold hours of having to rebuild the whole thing. Further, he taught me how to use the invaluable built-in back-up feature of the Viux service, so I can repair the site if I ever do anything as stupid again. If you're a cyper-whizz this may sound really dumb to you. But if you're cyber illiterate like me, Viux is the ISP you need, because you can count on all the support, help and hand-holding you will EVER need."
ViUX.com,www.viux.com,Mike Bernardi,"Thursday, October 31, 2013","The support staff is always there when I need them and they are quick to resolve any issue that comes up. They are a true pleasure to deal with. If you're on the fence about going with Viux or one of these other mass domain hosting companies that offer ridiculously low ""introductory"" pricing, don't think about it, just go with Viux. You will not be disappointed."

I was worried when it came to hosting my site and maintaining it. A friend of mine suggested to go with ViUX and I did choose ViUX based on the recommendation from my friend. I have been with ViUX for over 6 years and they have been great. Easy to manage my site, interface is not that complicated, and the support is the best. You get fast resolution of issues and you can talk to a person who knows their stuff. Great job ViUX. I highly recommend you. In fact I did make a couple more sites for my friends and used ViUX. Thanks!"

HostSailor,www.hostsailor.com,Austin,"Thursday, August 27, 2015",Extremely happy in my choice with HostSailor for VPS hosting. Their customer service people are very responsive and professional. I ordered an Ubuntu VM from them and I'm very happy with the product. It has all the base software you'd expect but without a bunch of pre-installed software. This is exactly what I was looking for and simply used apt-get to install my application dependencies. I did quite a bit of research prior to choosing HostSailor. They offer a fantastic product from a company I could trust at a VERY competitive price. It's been a pleasure working with them and I'd recommend them to anyone I know.

Bitronic Technologies,www.bitronictech.net,John Cusack,"Monday, April 2, 2012",I got a free domain from this site when I bought my web hosting. I spoke directly to the owner of the company.

CaVPS Host,www.cavpshost.com,James Krause,"Thursday, August 25, 2016",My experience with CaVPS Host has been overall quite Good. I say this because they seem to be quite knowledgeable and handy in the event your website is under a DDos Attack.  This was the reason we signed up with them after reading up on a forum site about them. We have been  the target of malacious hackers for sometime now and they kept hitting us offline with layer 7 dispute us using cloudflare.Their staff did something to our firewall with fail2ban to filter our traffic and we have never been offline ever since. I highly recommend this host to anyone seeking ddos protected hosting and a friendly helpful atmosphere.

I worked for AT&T; for a year before I started this business. It was very hard to give great customer service and calm a customer down and I heard their voice. So coming from that stand point and seeing that Duncan only spoke with me through Ebay messages and Email and made me feel like we were working face to face.........That's big and I want you to know that he is a asset to the company and as long as he's there so will my business and every business owner in Atlanta that I know will be reached out to in the coming weeks. I was skeptical about purchasing my website through Ebay and he helped me to make a smoove transition and to make the site my home and for that I am grateful!

Important factor of webhosting choice for me was location, so I have decided to use Italian datacenter for my targeted audience. Since they helped me move and setup my websites everything is working smoothly. I find their technical support truly skilled, all my daemons are working without errors. So far downtime has never happened and pingdom uptime monitoring shows 99.97%. Network is what I looked for with low ping to my users, so it is perfect.Support team is working impressively. If you will ask me to rate their service I would give them 8/10, because nothing is perfect in our world. Sure everyone have some issues with functioning, but they fix them in an instant.

That is great to be assured in your company and their workers. Uptime has never been a problem. My sites are online all the time and I get stability as guaranteed. As for performance of network and servers it is rather good. Sometimes I got slow working ftp and packet loss, but it was a trouble from my side according to tracert. All services which are included to plan are working fine. I heard some people are getting troubles with e-mail delivery or DB performance, but mine is working at highest level of stability. Overall I'd like to thank to all the 7host.com team. You are bringing quality service high level customer care."

European Networks,www.en.ee,Mario Uait,"Tuesday, June 19, 2012",The price isn't really cheap but it's worth all the money. They has helped me a lot to configure my server and optimize it. Overall I'm really satisfied with their professional service and can recommend to every business owner.

SkyToaster,skytoaster.com,Mat Jones,"Monday, October 10, 2016","We host quite a large number of sites and used to balance them through a variety of hosting solutions for various purposes.  Once we started using SkyToaster, we decided to move all of them onto their hosting platform. The team is incredibly helpful, responsive and take all of the grunt work of server administration off of our plate.I highly recommend SkyToaster for their awesome support and solutions. They have helped us grow our hosting options and consolidate our billing. "
SkyToaster,skytoaster.com,D. Strout,"Friday, July 4, 2014","Though I have only been with the company for a couple of months, I have so far from the service to be excellent.  Patrick was able to give me a custom solution in their well-appointed Seattle location. The server has been fast and stable and I love their new control panel. I participate in the VPSBoard forum, which is where I originally saw their ad, & I was happy to see several SkyToaster employees participate there too. Though their managed solutions are somewhat pricy, all in all, I would not hesitate to recommend this company to anyone "
SkyToaster,skytoaster.com,YJ Tso,"Thursday, July 3, 2014","I've been with Skytoaster for years now, moving from shared hosting to a VPS, and after working with nearly a dozen different hosting providers, I can't imagine a better home for my primary server. Skytoaster fan for life here, and they've gone above and beyond to earn that loyalty from me. Patrick and Sal are top notch guys."
SkyToaster,skytoaster.com,Susan Ottwell,"Thursday, July 3, 2014","While almost any shared hosting provider will pretty much do the job, the key factor in selecting a hosting provider has to be the service.  As a 25-year veteran of working with computers, I can assure you that there is no such thing as perfect hardware that never fails.  And there are a million and one ways to configure a million and one variations on server software. Patrick and the rest of the SkyToaster people are good. They know their stuff, and they're fast and friendly. I've never once had any support issue get a boilerplate ""it must be your software"" response, and I like to push the envelope and find the corner-case issues.Especially if you're a user of the MODX CMS, you're not going to get better hosting or support. Patrick is an active member of the MODX forum community, so SkyToaster support is extra-capable at dealing with MODX Revolution's quirks and server requirements."

Our initial interaction with their technical support was great as well as others. They always quickly helped us to move and setup our sites everything is working smoothly. We approve that network connection is pretty fast and their hosting control panel ""cPanel"" is user friendly. Couple of times we have errors due to wrong configurations of our databases but that was due to we haven't configured our CMS properly. Many thanks for provided high quality services to us."
AlphaRacks Hosting,www.alpharacks.com,Geof Kirby,"Tuesday, October 11, 2016",Constant barrage of spam emails from these people and I'm not even in the same country. They are totally unresponsive to demand to desist. That's likely their attitude to customer service - take the money and run..

Now they have been unreachable for the last 17 hours and I have no information when they will fix it... They are cheap, but if you need a reliable service the it's definitely not the way to go."
BigScoots,www.BigScoots.com,Jason,"Monday, July 23, 2012","BigScoots has taken what seemed to be an enormously complex task that would have taken even the largest of companies weeks to complete and got it done in a matter of days. Their support is amazing and to be honest if you haven't tried them you're just hurting yourself. They've got a money back guarentee, not that you'll need it, so give it a go, you'll be glad you did."
Catalyst Host,www.catalysthost.com,Michel Staake,"Thursday, April 18, 2013","Catalyst Host isn't just another VPS host. They actually care about customers and they actually have a passion for the service they provide, rather than just seeing dollar signs on their servers like most VPS Hosts. They run a tight ship and it shows; my VPS has been rock solid and extremely stable, even after I managed to screw it up big time, they kept me online. Ticket responses are as fast as my VPS (that's a good thing), and the problem is almost always resolved and explained properly in the first reply. They have a node reboot planned soon; two ahead of time notifications and a message on their site, shows they are running a transparent operation and have their customers as their first priority. Anyway, you can't go wrong with Catalyst Host and while I'm only a VPS customers I'm sure their Web Hosting is equally excellent!"
Cookies Domain Shop,www.cookiesdomainshop.com,John,"Friday, July 22, 2016","Cookie's Domain Shop seems to have all the products GoDaddy has, except generally for less, without the asterisk caveat, i.e. an asterisk with a mile of requisite other purchases in order to get the advertised price.  The prices are what they are, so if you have a lot of domains (defensive domains, etc.) it becomes a considerable cost savings to do business with Cookie's Domain Shop.They have American-based support.  In fact, its the same support people GoDaddy has (we do business with both companies), so woohoo for the cost savings!"
DedicatedNode,www.dedicatednode.com,John Anthony,"Friday, October 24, 2014","Purchased a dedicated server, I was a little worried at because could not find many user reviews (one of the reasons why I am letting people know) but the price they provided was great so I said I will give them a try. Management is superb. Mike the owner checked in on the service a few days after it was deployed and just recently almost a month after it has been deployed. No network down time, fast support and the owner gave me his direct cell phone number in case a ticket took to long to reply. Out of the other hosting companies I have been with no one has taken care of me like DedicatedNode.On the downside, I do wish they offered technical support via live chat and their phone support is lacking but its all made up with the direct access to the owner and the fast repsone from the support department.If that was not the case this would have been a 3 maybe 4 star review but because of the level of access you get to the company's management team, its a 5 even though they do not offer live chat support and their phone support options needs improvement.Hope to continue doing business and I will updte this review in the coming months."
DediMonster,www.dedimonster.com,Greg,"Friday, January 9, 2015","We currently use Dedimonster and Gigabox Hosting for our Website and business VPS and IT business solution.

The best thing is customer support, any question you have will be answered within 10 minutes. The price is very reasonable compared to other hosts I've seen. I also just opened another site with them and I got a nice discount on that for already having another account with them so I thought that was nice. As for customer support I absolutely love it.I would strongly recommend Jumpline to anyone who is looking for a good hosting company. Currently we are hosting 5 sites with them and have nothing but good things to say."

The technical support solved my problems so fast so that now I have more spare time than before.

They not only respond in a timely fashion, but their techs will work with you to make sure your problem is solved and not just sweep it under the rug.  Their great hosting plans make it flexible and refreshing for customers.   The cost is very comparable to the competition and the value for what you get in your plans is second to none.  I not only host my business with Remly but I recommend ALL my clients to them.  They have plans for any platform, large or small.  I invite anyone to give them a look.   You will not look back. "

Highly recommended.
Calliflower,www.calliflower.com,Sam Ifergan,"Wednesday, December 18, 2013",We did lots of research on this before picking a vendor. I love the security-level thing in Calliflower. Its nice to know that you can lock-down a call and keep it super private. No-one else has that feature!

To be fair, it's understandable as their competition is huge and advertising spend must be gigantic as other companies ads are plastered everywhere.We moved from a competitor of Meet Up Call that has a brand name that sounds like they should be creating meetings for Red Indians who were absolutely horrendous and cost us a fortune.

JotForm,www.jotform.com,Michael L.,"Tuesday, May 7, 2013","So far I couldn't be more pleased with JotForm! In my experience, the downside of a hosted service like this is that most such services only have limited ability to customize the design. But JotForm give you complete control over the css. This is a game changer (I didn't realize this until I got into it, so they seem not to do a good job of advertising this point). You can use any of their designs out-of-the-box, or you can tweak anything/everything about them so that they fit flawlessly into your site's design. I'm only scratching the surface of the features of JotForm. Each time that I start to wonder if JotForm lets me do 'X' the answer has always been yes. Very impressed."

While all other form generators I have used in the past have glaring flaws, such as overly-intrusive ads, or a non-customisable design. Jotform has neither of these, but has a whole load of fantastic features suitable for any company, large or small.

duda,www.dudamobile.com,Ben,"Monday, November 2, 2015",The program itself is good and fairly easy even for amateurs like me.  But there are always a few nagging elements that need refinement and that's where tech support comes in.When we started with dudamobile a few years ago they had phone support which made things a lot simpler.  Back then I would have given them 5 stars.They have since dropped phone support so everything is by email with a lag factor of 2 days or more.  That's not particularly customer friendly.  The fixes they give you don't always work so you have a series of 48 hour lag times which can go on for weeks.Phone support is expensive so they probably would need to charge more for that feature.  That would be OK with me and well worth avoiding the frustration of having to deal with a series of emails over an extended period of time.

Spambrella,www.spambrella.com,Michael Casio,"Friday, July 4, 2014","Very happy with the quick support moving us from another vendor who we felt were over charging us. After using Spambrella now for 4 months we have realised we also get more features and better policies than we had with the previous vendor. We are more secure, have direct focus and support and I got a pat on the back for saving half of the budget! Recommended."
Spambrella,www.spambrella.com,James McAinsley,"Thursday, May 1, 2014","These guys helped with a large Postini migration. We had some 4000ish domains routed through the service which was failing and support was a struggle with Google. After some research we had a look at Spambrella, ran a 30 day demo on a handful of willing client domains. The results and difference in support/general spam reduction was immense. Couldn't recommend this company any higher."

ADDR,www.addr.com,Eric,"Tuesday, September 1, 2015","ADDR.COM was a reasonably good host for my website for about 10 years ... until, in late 2013, incessant technical problems appeared, reappeared and wouldn't go away.  Incoming e-mail simply disappeared, or never arrived.  My website was up, down, up, down, down, slow, up, etc.  With about two exceptions, MANY of my attempted phone and e-mail complaints were answered by an ""autoresponder"" and ignored by real people.  The exceptions?  Five or six months (yes, months) after I sent 40  complaint messages, somebody at addr.com finally did reply via e-mail.  He  explained they had been busy, apologized for the delay, had no idea what my problem was, and suggested that I try again to contact them if I still needed assistance.   That poor excuse of an offer to help came WAY Too Late.  Months earlier I had switched to a new web host (ARVIXE.COM).   Five months ago my 2-year prepaid ""subscription"" for ADDR.COM's services ran out.  Obviously I did not renew for another 2-year term.  Despite my complaints and messages saying to cancel my account, plus my refusal to pay any more, ADDR.COM's tunnel-vision ""pay now or else"" billing department continues to try to automatically charge my credit card.  Thankfully, that credit account is no longer active or I'd be forced to repeatedly dispute unwelcome and unauthorized charges by ADDR.COM.  One more thing.  As it turned out, I should have switched much sooner.  ADDR.COM's ""control panel"" performs a few basic tasks, but other web hosts' control panels are FAR better.   MY RECOMMENDATION -- SKIP ADDR.COM, do NOT give them your credit card number, and go elsewhere for a website & e-mail host. "
ADDR,www.addr.com,Richard Ascot,"Monday, August 19, 2013",Very trusted company and good web hosting services. I have not been let down.  I recommend ADDR to other business owners in my area.

They dont care about their client nor their websites, their server is mostly down. If at all you approach their live chat support, they will just ask you to open a ticket, which on the other hand is never answered. Hosting website on xozz server is a big risk. You might lose all your website data without a single notification. It happened me twice. A week ago, their server went down. I approached their live support (Mr William & James Patroic). These guys informed me that their server has crashed. They asked me to change the DNS of my website to switch to their new server. Now, after changing the DNS their server started working fine, but my website data from the old server has not been migrated to the new one. Ive been reaching out their support team every single day, spending hour and hours to get some positive response from their end but no luck yet. I do have the backup, but when I try to upload it, I get the below error message. Unable to upload the backup file. The file either contains modified or corrupted data, or it was created on another server or in an older Panel version. To restore data from this file, contact your hosting provider. It clearly says, Contact your hosting provider. I dont know in which other way I need to contact them. I have tried all possible ways of getting help from their end, but they really dont care. Its been almost a week my website is down. So with all my frustration, I am writing this review just to inform others that dont even think of hosting your websites on xozz. Else, just like me, you will spend most of your time in cursing yourself for choosing xozz."

I have tried opening ticket where surprisingly they ask which domain I have bought from them. I mean I am a registered member and they don't even have a record of mine. Anyway even after answering their stupid questions I am not having any luck with them. They just suck and I don't have any hesitation in saying that.

DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Kierstead,"Thursday, August 4, 2016",I switched to Dailyrazor over 9 months ago and have been extremely pleased with their web hosting service. Everything has worked flawlessly. I have been able to manage my account with several domains from the client user interface which is very easy to navigate. The plesk interface also works great. I have rarely had to contact the support team for anything and on the occasions when I have they responded immediately with an email from an actual person who resolved my issues right away.Their network support has been very good at helping me setup a domain and then transfer another domain to my account. I really enjoy my experience dealing Dailyrazor team. Recommended.

DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Dewayne Willcutt,"Tuesday, July 5, 2016","Really good hosting provider that goes the extra mile to help their customers. Dailyrazor support team always so helpful and resolves issues as soon as they are given. They are honest about any issues arising and explain why issues happen.Their servers are also faster than one would expect for shared hosting, much faster than some other hosts I've used.I have never been aware of any downtime - this is a great plus for their team of experts.Look no further - this host gets Double Thumbs!"
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Olen Haugen,"Thursday, June 23, 2016","I will be migrating all my current customers, their sites, hosting and domains to Dailyrazor next week.The application packs they now support also help facilitate almost effortless setup of great commonly used web based applications. I am very much satisfied by their customer service, they are available 24/7 and provide instant service whenever required.And the server cost is way too cheap. And the technical support is just awesome.You can't go wrong with this web hosting provider! Would highly recommend to others."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Karim Galle,"Thursday, June 2, 2016","Finally I've found a good home for my wordpress blogs. I have used over 5 web hosts before and chose Dailyrazor 6 months ago, and was really impressed. Now I have much better speed, network uptime (without any downtime), nice scripts. They even offer web design solutions - this is a great plus for them. They also do e-commerce design. They gave me a FREE Domain Name registration!I am happy using their hosting & design services - pricing is reasonable."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Schoenberger,"Wednesday, May 25, 2016","I can express the point that Dailyrazor is one of the best places where you can order shared hosting plans at good rates.When I contacted their sales representative, he shared nice coupon code: 15PD - it gave me 15% off the price!I love the prices. The server was down for about 15 minutes one month. So far, I am extremely impressed with these guys. There is nothing that counts more than decent support, they go beyond the call. I really hope the rest of the support team are like this.They are the most professional and engaging technical experts I've dealt with in the past 10 years.Good uptime, fast speed, helpful support - I am totally impressed with these guys!"
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Nicholas Tynan,"Tuesday, May 17, 2016","I have been with DailyRazor for about 8 months now and it has been nothing but perfect. I have never witnessed a second of downtime, my websites load with blazing fast speed, and there customer service really isn't bad at all. As long as you set your payments to them to be automated (I have seen people had problems with their billing issues) and your not going to flood them with support questions (I have submitted up to 2 a day for about a week straight at one time due to my own fault and received nothing but polite, well spoken, helpful answers). Sure my questions weren't all that difficult but I have never had any problems with this host so I have no reason to complain.Overall, this host is great. Good support, good server speeds, reliable hosting, awesome prices!5/5 A  Host I recommend to all."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Benny,"Friday, May 6, 2016","As a developer, I now use Dailyrazor to host every website that I build. I have used other hosts, but I have to say that this decent host offers the same level of performance and features for much less money. Support is usually great, my only complain being that the original average support response time of 10 minutes is now more like 30-40 minutes. This is to be expected with the kind of growth they've experienced, however.I have not noticed any downtime or slow browsing speed. Some of my sites are e-commerce, so database speed is important.I would recommend DailyRazor hosting to anyone who is looking for a new host! The prices are good, customer support is awesome and it is quite reliable!"
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Rickey Direnzo,"Monday, April 25, 2016","I followed a friend's suggestion and decided to give dailyrazor a try.  I must say that I so happy with their service.  They make things so easy - trust me!  They got a custom website designed for me, manage and host the site at a ridiculously affordable price.   their web servers are fast and stable and I have no issues with viruses and malwares unlike before at my previous web host.  Before you spend your hard earned money elsewhere, give them a try.  I highly recommend this them."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Cameron Fishburn,"Thursday, April 14, 2016","These guys are just awesome!  They are never down and their technical support is superb - support tickets and live chat tend to get a response within minutes, which usually resolves the problem. I know Im not good in properly describing tech issues, but they always tend to find the understand and way to solve the issue. Their server and network up-time are cool and overall speed connectivity is outstanding and consistent.I wish they had more payment options. Bitcoin for example as I had to use my credit card when I'd prefer to use Bitcoin. Hope they will add that soon. They are good for running any kind of web sites, taking into account the abundance of useful features included into their hosting packages.Highly Recommended!"
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Anderson Gelinas,"Tuesday, April 5, 2016","Having used several web hosts for some years and most of them providing sluggish service, the last host was so bad that I started shopping around for a new host.While doing Google search I found Dailyrazor, looked at their homepage (it looked professionally designed) and found out they offered affordable hosting plans. On the account of the fact I decided to contact them directly. They offered me a good hosting solution for my needs. Special requests have always come through quickly and gracefully.But I switched from Cpanel host to Plesk and as result that was uncomfortable for me a bit. I had to contact support to get help.  But now I have learned a bit  Plesk thanks to that.Uptime since we moved has been 100%  (as far as I can see  maybe in real that is different) and the server is always fast and stable.Speed load of pages is really fast - I am very glad with this and can highly recommend this web host to others."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Duncan Amison,"Thursday, March 24, 2016","Having used several web hosting providers before now Im with DailyRazor. I dare say they provide me with  better services then I used to have, but still have some moments I want them to improve for me.Support guys are very fast with their responses and help (but I did not have some serious issues I suppose). And I do understand that is their TOP priority to be as fast as  possible.But sales (or billing)  department not that fast. I had the situation when my  Credit  card expired and payment was not successful I had to wait for about an hour for them to come up with solution for me. Yes they did what I wanted but not that fast as expected.Their control panel is not custom made. They use Cpanel is 100% easy to use and it is amazing.  That is good point because some hosting providers what to  be different and start creating their own panels. I do not like this and it was the reason of me moving from them.Hosting related part: no downtime, fast servers, no email is lost -  more then enough for me.Price: neither high nor low. Fair enough.Notwithstanding that their sales is not that fast I can recommend DailyRazor."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Chung Geddie,"Monday, March 14, 2016","Have had great experience with Dailyrazor guys. I've had numerous others in the past, only for them to cause hours of work with every change they made to their systems. Never had a problem with them, except a server glitch, which they took care of within 40 minutes of my notifying them. Great prices and package deals, too. If you have a one or more sites you may well have many years of happy service with them. I highly recommend DailyRazor to anyone looking for a courteous and reliable web host provider."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Dave Dahmen,"Wednesday, March 2, 2016","First of all I have to say that I was referred to the DailyRazor, by my friend. But I had not been told that I would be called for verification. I used my sisters credit card (with her permission) and they started suspecting that card was stolen. I paid several time in the internet using her card, but it was first time I was contacted to verify that as well as my sister.  I was not happy about that and that is negative side of their service as for me.I can say that my website is always online and I have never had downtime. That is the best option. I have one email  with them and none of emails has been lost. I have not used their support assistance, since Im fine and they have Cpanel and that is easy to manage.But overall service is great and Im satisfied. I think they need to change their approach to new clients and there should be more trust from them.I recommend DailyRazor. "

Their control panels are easy to use and intuitive, as is their account and billing interface. I am very satisfied with this service and will recommend it to anyone."
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Vishy Steinegger,"Friday, February 5, 2016","Must say that Dailyrazor hosting service has impressed me a lot with network uptime, fast speed connectivity and helpful customer support. It is a great host and I have refered many friends to them and none of us have ever experienced any problems. According to the lists I have seen they are one of the fastest growing hosting companies in the world which is most likely the reason other hosts does not like them. My website response times have never been faster and support level is above and beyond. If you are thinking about switching, this is the host to go with. "
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Kayla Eggert,"Tuesday, January 26, 2016","I'd like to point out that Dailyrazor is the best host I've ever tried before. I decided to try their service from recommendation of one forum member at hosting discussion board. I ordered their basic shared hosting plan in order to host one of my personal web sites. Frankly speaking I was impressed with the uptime, speed and immediate customer support help and finally decided to transfer all my web sites to them. They were very helpful in transferring files to their servers.I'm happy, so I can highly recommend their hosting service to all webmasters looking for professional hosting service."

Lots of features, very knowledgeable fast and friendly support and the price is reasonable. I like their free options: FREE Custom Web Design and FREE Social Media Setup. Moreover, I used to try their website builder which is free, and they have unique free templates. It is a great pleasure to work with them.The speed of my sites is great, I have only positive feedbacks from my visitors about the work of my site.A really big Thank You to all dailyrazor staff!"
DailyRazor.com,www.dailyrazor.com,Denise Berube,"Monday, December 16, 2013","It took some research, viewing various places and participating on forums over at least a couple of months, reading various subjects, what staff of various hosts where saying etc. Once I had a more informed opinion I saw some good hosts including Dailyrazor and this one I chose; their bandwidth is good. As for the support, if something goes wrong they usually respond within several hours and check to see if the problem has been fixed to your satisfaction. Uptime is good. And I have never had a problem using their control panel. I can also add that it supports virtually all web development technologies on its hosting servers. Given their recent upgrades and expanded offerings I see no reason I would ever go anywhere else. Overall, Dailyrazor hosting is amazing!"

Beginning in 2011 it seems their servers would go down every other month.  They would give multiple reasons as to why the servers went down or why you could not access your website.  the most common excuse is a security issue.  They never tell what the security issue is you just have to believe them.  They will never give you information even when you ask them.  Once they upgraded RVSitebuilder and lost some of my data.  They do not keep backups as other webhosting companies do, so you're on your own.Be very careful of this company, I still have not received a reply or refund for over 1 years service since cancelling with them.Not trustworthy and you can find better comanies out there."

Look past the pricing and look at the true value and security that having a Cadillac hosting offering means for your website/business/blog and more.

I am going to try and save you all allot of time and anguish in searching countless hosts to find the best, believe me when I say I have spent nearly two weeks doing this, I have talked to countless people, read article after article, even checked out the so called best ten, I have even given three hosts the benefit of doubt, but never have I found a hosting company, that make you feel special, put your needs first, and more importantly spend time with you to ensure your happy with the products, service and customer care that this company offer. If you are lucky enough to speak to either Alex or Travis then you really will have struck gold, they will answer all your questions, put your mind at ease and more importantly won't rush you into a decision. And no I don't work for them or know them personally. If you still think you can do better than these then I personally challenge you, but I can guarantee you wont!!"
Flywheel,www.getflywheel.com,David Medina,"Monday, August 12, 2013","I just switched some of my websites from a shared account at Hostgator over to a managed wordpress hosting at Flywheel.  I can only say... WOW!!! I found my perfect hosting.Their customer service is amazing. They respond quickly and stay with you until they help you out. They moved my site for free from Hostgator in no time at all. After I made sure everything was working right, and it was, the switchover was easy and quick. Next week they are calling me to teach me all the in and outs. A personal call! Great customer service is much more that being available 24/7 but actually having knowledgeable people that can help you without handing you over to someone else. Their admin panel is gorgeously simple and straightforward. And the speed is, well, lighting fast. No CDN needed (they offer it if you need  or want one). My experience has been so amazing with Flywheel that they just became my new home for my websites. I am sure many other companies are great, but I need not look any further as Flywheel is my perfect hosting."

From the the first moment I spoke to Jesse, I could tell he actually knew what he was talking about. I have had him moved all of my websites over to virtual private servers and it has phenomenally increased the speed of them for me. I have being with Jesse from the start as he created LittleBizzy, and I have watched how he and his team have quickly become the authority in this niche market that he now dominates.

Function Point,www.functionpoint.com,Carrie McDonald,"Tuesday, October 27, 2015","At a small agency of about 15-20 people, we've decided to switch to Function Point because of its enhanced functionality. We are fully transitioned and continue to learn new things about the system every day and how it will best suit our needs. Training was informative and the staff are truly wonderful with quick response time.  My advice - don't prolong the launch of this sytem - start loading your company information as you go through training and involve all staff. Also, integrating Simply Accounting with FP can be done but it is not entirely friendly - apparently Quickbooks works much better. Overall, the staff at FP are extremely helpful and merely a message away - I don't know how we could have done this without them! Thanks to Ross, Jo and Marc!  "
Function Point,www.functionpoint.com,John W. Penney,"Tuesday, October 20, 2015","My firm has been using Function Point for over 5 years. Before we decided to go with FP, we created an in-house team to evaluate FP along with 5 or so other applications. FP was the clear winner and we have not had any regrets with our decision to go with FP.Some of the other applications we reviewed offered built in accounting and we really did not like this approach. We felt like it was better to let the Quickbooks of the world worry about the accounting as they have hundreds of experts dedicated to keeping their application updated. We wanted our solution to focus on all the other parts that are necessary to running a profitable agency and dedicate their team to making that the best that it could be. FP's seamless integration with Quickbooks, gave us the best of both worlds.FP listens. If we have product improvement suggestions they listen and often incorporate those into their ongoing software updates. Not to say they do every crazy thing we suggest, but the stuff that makes sense for all their clients always make it into the updates.Finally, A company is only as strong as its support and FP has delivered to our firm the highest level of support. We deal with other online software solutions on behalf of our clients and no other company comes close to the support FP give us."

Function Point,www.functionpoint.com,Susan Leader,"Wednesday, September 9, 2015","As a small agency, making the change to this system was a daunting task. Function Point seemed like it would fit the bill, but I was worried about the learning curve, and what if I didnt like it after we got into the thick of it? I knew, however, that this should be a good move - we needed to do this before we grow and add more people. The system has everything I need and much I didnt know Id want. Setting up was challenging but Jim our FP expert here (and the guy who discovered you) was chomping at the bit to get this going and took total control of setting us up. Between the two of us we really rocked set up which means the system is very Mac-minded. This year was our first full year on the system and everyone here loves it for many different reasons and we are still only scratching the surface of what it can do. Time keeping and invoicing is now a breeze, for me I have started to check everyones weekly time just to be sure everything has been entered, I caught days of missing entries, I had assumed everyone was entering time on a regular basis. Its like finding money! Too many reasons to say why I love this system. I know more, save time, can access anywhere-anytime. My key people can access everything if Im not here. I especially like attaching printing invoices to the job so anyone can access it instead of me going through my files to find it.On another note, we couldnt have gotten through all this without the web classes, and Youtube videos. Makes for a wonderful way to learn. Then there are your problem solvers. Every question I have ever had was addressed promptly and explained so I could follow through. I think that is really important. Makes me feel even better just knowing I can get answers when I need them.Thanks for changing our business for the better! Why am I writing now? Well, as I opened the program to start my day I realized Im really on top of this now. It isn't forced I gotta do this"", or remembered dam-it I forgot to enter..."", its habit. Im at a point now where it does what I need and Im sure I only use the surface. I just assume if I can think it up, I bet its already there. "

WorkflowMax,www.workflowmax.com,Leaine Jones,"Tuesday, August 12, 2014","At Jones Business Solutions we used WFM to move off MYOB Time Billing - conservative estimate that saved around 10-12 hours each month with invoicing. Even better now to have the Tax Practice - previously used an excel template for financials - the combination with WFM, Xero and Spotlight Workpapers is sensational for a small Tax Agency like us. WFM Support is prompt and helpful and we love WFM so much we now regularly implement and support other businesses wanting to get the max out of job costing and reporting. Have tested other similar systems and yet to see something that stands out for a comparable price. We have used since 2011; we operate in a virtual office and users are both employees and contractors. Pros: Timesavings for billing and quoting Seamless integration with Xero Tax practice version - auto synch with IRD Good functionality with reporting Brilliant for our virtual officeCons: Work arounds needed for retentions - but to be fair not really designed for construction industry - but it can work Not too much else that is a problem - especially for the price."

WorkflowMax,www.workflowmax.com,Jason George,"Thursday, July 3, 2014","Steelcraft  an engineering and fabrication firm  have been in the business for more than 20 years. We had a custom-build spreadsheet system for managing jobs, and it was a disaster. We weren't tracking time or costs in a consistent way, and we would spend hours creating quotes or invoices. Sometimes clients would forget to pay their invoices, and we wouldn't notice for six months. When we started growing rapidly, the problems got even worse. Luckily, WorkflowMax came along.Now we can accurately track job costs and time spent, and instantly see if we're turning a profit. WorkflowMax is also very flexible  some clients want to be invoiced weekly, some monthly, others want very detailed information and reports on their invoices. WorkflowMax does all this with a few clicks.I used to go home in the evenings and spend hours doing the invoicing and quoting. WorkflowMax has given me this time back, so I can spend time with my family and tuck my kids in at night."

This meant that a lot of time was spent flicking from system to system to find relevant information which looking back was a really poor use of time and gave us less time to devote to our actual clients.Since implementing Workflow Max it has really helped by providing an integrated platform which enables us to work in a much more effective and productive way. By having all the information in one place it's a seamless process for taking all client work through from the start to the end - all using one, very user friendly system. "
