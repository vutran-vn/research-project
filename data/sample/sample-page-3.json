It is almost worth signing up for Xero and then choosing your bank as not all banks are equal. One note is their pricing model, depending on how your business is structured you can find that there is only one small aspect of Xero that is relevant. This would mean you need to move higher up their model. Whether it be the number of invoices or multi-currency support you can find your costs increasing due to a need for one small aspect.
